As part of strengthening the victim support services in the State, the Government of Kerala has started this scheme which provides financial aid to dependents as well as victims of crime. The assistance would benefit those who were struggling to make a living, including dependents of the victims of the crime and those with serious injuries. \n      When a crime is committed it can have significant, yet varying consequences, on the individual who became the victim of the crime and his family. The devastating impact of crime results in emotional, psychological, and physical as well as financial consequences. If the head of the family is killed or injured in a crime, the family is left without the main breadwinner. Killing or seriously injuring the earning member of the household as a result of the crime will deprive a family of their livelihood.\n",

REMEDIAL COACHING FOR SC/ST/OBC (NON-CREAMY LAYER) &amp; MINORITY COMMUNITY STUDENTS** \nRemedial Coaching is to be organized at the Undergraduate and /or Postgraduate level with objectives to: \n\n- Improve the academic skills and linguistic proficiency of the students in various subjects. \n- To raise their level of comprehension of basic subjects to provide a stronger foundation for further academic work. \n- To strengthen their knowledge, skills, and attitudes in such subjects, where quantitative and qualitative techniques and laboratory activities are involved, so that, the necessary guidance and training provided under the program may enable the students to come up to the level necessary for pursuing higher studies efficiently and to reduce their failure and dropout rate. \n- To provide career guidance and psychological counseling for capacity building to those who are in need of such counseling.  \n\n<br>\n\n**II.

The University may develop Employment Information Cell for providing information about various competitive examinations in the area of their operation.  \n\n<br>\n\n**III.  COACHING FOR NATIONAL ELIGIBILITY TEST OR STATE ELIGIBILITY TEST FOR SC/ST/OBC (NON-CREAMY LAYER) &amp; MINORITY COMMUNITY STUDENTS** \nThe main objective of the scheme is to prepare Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Minority Communities candidates for appearing in NET or SET so that a sufficient number of candidates becomes available for selection as Lecturers in the university system. \n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n",
        "benefits_md": "The institutions can apply for one or more components of the scheme according to the number of enrolment of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, OBC (Non-Creamy Layer), and Minorities Communities Students.

Increase the amenity value of cities by developing greenery and well maintained open spaces (e.g. parks) and\n1. Reduce pollution by switching to public transport or constructing facilities for non-motorized transport (e.g. walking and cycling). \n\n<br>\n\nAll these outcomes are valued by citizens, particularly women, and indicators and standards have been prescribed by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA ) in the form of Service Level Benchmarks (SLBs).\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n#### Thrust Areas\nThe Mission will focus on the following Thrust Areas:\n<br>\n\n\n1. Water Supply\n1. Sewerage and septage management\n1. Storm Water Drainage to reduce flooding\n1. Non-motorized Urban Transport\n1. Green space/parks\n\n#### Coverage\n**Five hundred cities** have been selected under AMRUT. The category of cities that have been selected under AMRUT is given below:\n<br>\n\n\n1. All Cities and Towns with a population of over one lakh with notified Municipalities as per Census 2011, including Cantonment Boards (Civilian areas),\n1. All Capital Cities/Towns of States/ UTs, not covered in above ,\n1. All  Cities/  Towns  classified  as  Heritage  Cities  by  MoHUA  under  the  HRIDAY Scheme,\n1. Thirteen Cities and Towns on the stem of the main rivers with a population above 75,000 and less than 1 lakh, and\n1.

There will be multilayered prioritization within the universe of eligible PMAY-G beneficiaries. Priority will first be assigned on the basis of parameters reflecting housing deprivation in each category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others. \nii.  To begin with, households will be prioritized based on houselessness followed by the number of rooms; zero, one, and two rooms, in that order. \niii.  In a particular social category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others, households that are houseless or living in houses with a lower number of rooms shall not be ranked below households living in houses with a higher number of rooms.\nWithin the above priority groups, households that fulfill the criteria of &quot;compulsory inclusion&quot;, will be further elevated. Automatically included households shall not rank lower than other households within a priority group. Inter-se priority within the two subgroups viz. households which are automatically included and otherwise will be determined based on their cumulative deprivation scores. \nThe scores will be calculated from the socio-economic parameters given below with each having equal weight:\ni.\tHouseholds with no adult member between ages 16 to 59\nii.\tFemale-headed households with no adult male member between ages 16 to 59\niii.\tHouseholds with no literate adult above 25 years\niv.\tHouseholds with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member\nv.\tLandless Households deriving the major part of their income from manual casual labor\nvi. Households with higher deprivation scores will be ranked higher within the subgroups.\n**Note:** _To ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived and that the selection is objective and verifiable, the housing deprivation parameters in the SECC data will be used for identifying households and then verified by the Gram Sabhas._\n> ***Earmarking of Targets -*** \n\n**For SC/ST:**\n60% of the target allocated to each State/ UT should be earmarked for SC/STs, subject to the availability of eligible beneficiaries. Within earmarked targets, the proportion of SC and ST is to be decided from time to time by the respective States/UTs. Further, the States/ UTs would be allowed to interchange targets between SC and ST if there are no eligible beneficiaries from either of the category and it is certified as such. In case all eligible SC and ST households are covered, the State/ UT targets would be allocated to beneficiaries from the &#39;Other&#39; categories included in the Permanent Wait List drawn from SECC 2011.\n**For Minorities:**\nFurther, as far as possible, 15% of the total fund would be earmarked for Minorities at the National Level for households. The allocation of targets for Minorities among the States/UTs will be on the basis of the proportionate rural population of Minorities in the respective State/UT as per Census 2011 data. Minorities notified under Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992 are to be considered eligible for receiving benefits against Minority earmarks.\n**For PwDs:**\nAccordingly, in the scheme of PMAY-G, while deciding the inter-se priority among the beneficiaries who are to be provided assistance, households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member have been accorded additional deprivation score so that such households are given priority while allotting the houses. Keeping in view the provisions of the Persons with Disabilities Act, of 1995, the States to the extent possible, may ensure that 3% of beneficiaries at the State Level are from among persons with disabilities.\n> **Tie Breaker**\n\nIn case there is a tie with more than one household within a subgroup having the same deprivation score, the households will be ranked according to priority on the basis of the following parameters:\ni.\tHouseholds with widows and next-of-kin of members of defence/paramilitary/police forces killed in action.\nii.\tHouseholds where a member is suffering from leprosy or cancer and People living with HIV (PLHIV).\niii.\tHouseholds with a single girl child.\niv.\tBeneficiary families of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, commonly known as the Forest Rights Act.\nv.\tTransgender persons.\n",
