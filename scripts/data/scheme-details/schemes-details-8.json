In several cases, higher yields per harvest were also reported.\n•\tAs Natural Farming does not use any synthetic chemicals, health risks and hazards are eliminated. The food has higher nutrition density and therefore offers better health benefits.\n•\tNatural Farming ensures better soil biology, improved agrobiodiversity and a more judicious usage of water with much smaller carbon and nitrogen footprints.\n•\tNatural Farming aims to make farming viable and aspirational by increasing net incomes of farmers on account of cost reduction, reduced risks, similar yields, incomes from intercropping.\n•\tBy working with diverse crops that help each other and cover the soil to prevent unnecessary water loss through evaporation, Natural Farming optimizes the amount of ‘crop per drop’.\n<br>\n\n",

Several Transgender students are not able to study regular courses in colleges but instead pursue Degree/Post Graduate courses via distance education. Due to their deprived financial conditions, they are unable to meet the expenses incurred for payment of Registration fees, Tuition fees, Exam fees, study materials, etc. \n**Aims &amp; Objectives:**\n\n   1. Majority of the transgender persons are either dropouts or discontinue education in the early stages and due to the stigma the family members also disown them. Since they are unable to find a sustainable livelihood, they suffer financially. This scheme will support transgender students to complete their education successfully and earn a decent living and make them financially independent.\n   1. With the help of this distance education scheme, transgender students will be able to pursue their desired courses.\n   1. Transgender persons who are eligible for higher studies can complete their education and secure a decent job to lead a dignified life. This will encourage them to be self-sufficient and will open up a world of opportunities for such a target population.\n\n",

The Umbrella scheme comprises 11 Schemes/Missions. These schemes look to develop the agriculture and allied sector holistically and scientifically to increase the income of farmers by enhancing production, productivity, and better returns on produce.\n<br>\n\nThe Sub-Mission on Seeds and Planting Material (SMSP) aims to increase the production of certified / quality seed, increase SRR, upgrade the quality of farm-saved seeds, strengthen the seed multiplication chain, promote new technologies and methodologies in seed production, processing, testing, etc., to strengthen and modernizing infrastructure for seed production, storage, certification, and quality, etc.\n<br>\n\n**Objectives of SMSP -** \n\n1. Increasing production of certified/ quality seed\n1. Increasing Seed Replacement rate (SRR) more particularly to achieve higher SRR in crops like paddy, gram, groundnut, cotton, etc. as recommended by the Consultative Group of the Ministry of Agriculture \n1. Upgrading the quality of farm-saved seeds with a specific objective to cover 60,000 villages and produce 100 lakh quintals of seed each year through farmers&#39; participatory seed production.\n1. Creation of Seed Infrastructure facilities in the Public Sector.\n1. Encouraging seed treatment, particularly for farm-saved seed.\n1. Strengthening the seed multiplication chain through assistance to the public and private sectors.\n1. Popularizing new varieties to encourage varietal replacement.\n1. Promoting new technologies and methodologies in seed production, processing, testing, etc.\n1. Strengthening and modernizing infrastructure for seed production, storage, certification, and quality control particularly to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Seeds Bill 2004/ISTA standards, and OECD certification.\n1. Facilitating the movement of seed from India in international trade and increasing its share to 10% by 2020 as envisaged in the new policy on seed development.\n1. Assisting and supporting public and private seed-producing organizations in the seed sector and encouraging partnerships.\n1. Ensuring availability of seed in contingent situations.\n1.

EYCs act as anchors and extend requisite support and mentoring to students. Each EYC has a BIRAC-supported pre-incubation space which offers infrastructure and equipment for basic research and experimentation by selected students. Advanced research needs are fulfilled through Bio-incubator Connect. \n**BIRAC-supported EYCs encompass the following:**\n\n  - Pre-incubation space (3,000 sq. ft. or more)\n  - Manage Fellowships for students\n  - Conduct Entrepreneurial Awareness Workshops for students\n\n**Roles and Responsibilities of EYCs:**\n\n  - View and process online applications received for fellowship\n  - Screen applications for eligibility and suitability for the scheme\n  - Carry out online Technical Review of eligible applications through Subject Experts (Reviewers)\n  - Shortlist proposals for interview(F2F/skype/telephonic) by an Expert Panel\n  - Communicate decision to applicants at each step of selection\n  - Seek BIRAC approval on the final selection of fellows or their eligibility\n  - Issue fellowship award letters to the selected candidates on behalf of BIRAC\n  - Release fellowship and research grant received from BIRAC\n  - Provide mentorship, handholding, and access to facilities at EYC and EYC Knowledge Partner for BIRAC’s Innovation and E-YUVA Fellows\n  - Monitor the targeted milestones\n  - Organize periodic review meetings\n  - Provide mentorship and handholding for domain expertise, entrepreneurship, and activities including but not limited to IP management, mobilizing resources, and other business development-related activities\n  - Provide platforms/opportunities for interaction with experts.\n  - Provide periodic updates and reports on the progress of Fellows to BIRAC\n  - Conduct entrepreneurial workshops\n  - Any other activity required for effective implementation of fellowships on mutual consent with BIRAC.\n\n&gt; **Tenure of EY Centres:**\n\nEYCs will be engaged for an initial duration of 3 years, extendable further based on performance review. The performance of the EYCs would be evaluated annually.\n&gt; **E-Yuva Knowledge Partner:**\n\nFor the mentoring of Innovation Fellows and for providing overall guidance to EYCs, BIRAC will assign engagement with BioNEST-supported Bio-incubators. Each EYC will be formally associated with a BioNEST-supported bio incubator, which shall provide necessary handholding and mentoring to EYCs and Innovation Fellows. The knowledge partner will engage with the fellows throughout the award period and provide overall guidance. Bio-incubators will act as brand ambassadors for the program and will help in its outreach.\n",

The scheme aims to provide free and nutritious meals to school children across the country. Under this initiative, a hot cooked meal is served to children in primary and upper primary schools.\n<br>\n\nThe primary objectives of the Mid Day Meals Scheme are twofold. Firstly, it seeks to improve the nutritional status of children, ensuring they receive a balanced diet and essential nutrients necessary for their growth and development. Secondly, it aims to increase school attendance and retention rates by removing the barrier of hunger and incentivizing parents to send their children to school.\n"
