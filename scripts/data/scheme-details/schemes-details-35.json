This platform will also be utilized for engaging with the public for awareness generation and getting feedback for improvement in the schemes and for effective public delivery of services. These will be provided logistic support through Gram Panchayats in convergence with the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, Ministry of Rural Development, and Common Service Centres (CSCs) run by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. \nInitially, it will be launched in identified States/UTs, preferably where Elected Women Representatives (EWRs) are heading the Gram Panchayats (GPs) in Aspirational Districts. In the first year, an awareness drive regarding legal, constitutional rights and entitlements under various schemes/ programs will be undertaken. In the second year, committed and socially respected women will be identified and extensively trained in all women-related laws and schemes and a formal setup of women collectives having 7 to 11 members will be made who will address the socio, economic, and cultural issues faced by the women of that area and will provide alternative resolution to disputes by mediation and by connecting them to the duty bearers. \nThe members or Nyaya Sakhis will be nominated / selected by the Gram Panchayat. The Nyaya Sakhis will amongst themselves select the head of the Nari Adalat, referred to as the „Mukhya Nyaya Sakhi‟ (MNS). The MNS will be responsible for all the activities and functioning of Nari Adalat in their respective jurisdiction. The tenure of Mukhya Nyaya Sakhi will generally be of six months after which a new MNS would be selected by Nyaya Sakhi.\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n",

To draw a scholarship under the renewal category, the beneficiary must pass in the particular year or be promoted to the next semester/year. In case the student could not pass all papers but was promoted to next year, as per extant rules, he/she may be considered for renewal of scholarships subject to the condition that no additional backlog, from previous years, is pending against his/her name. \n1. In case the student is not promoted to next year or has backlog papers pending against his/her name for more than one year, he/she shall not receive a further scholarship for the remaining course period. It will be the responsibility of the Institute level verifying officer to ensure that the student has been promoted for a year or does not have pending backlog papers for more than a year, before accepting the application on NSP for further processing. Otherwise, such applications shall be rejected on NSP after recording reasons.\n1. Any break in scholarship, during the entire course period, shall make the beneficiary non-eligible for further receipt of the scholarship for that specific course.

The student may, however, apply as a fresh applicant, upon securing admission in any advanced course, at a later stage.\n1. A request for renewal of students who have changed their subject of study will not be entertained for renewal if the students have availed of the scholarship for the previous course or part of it.\n1. A request for renewal of scholarship of such student beneficiaries who have changed their Institution of study will not be entertained for renewal.\n1. There will be no merit list generation for renewal applications.\n1.

Broad features of the scheme are:\n\n  - All banks, including the Nagaland Cooperative Banks, will be eligible and shall be encouraged to participate in the Scheme.\n  - There will be a district-wise allocation, which will be decided by a State Level Committee headed by the Chief Secretary. This will help avoid skewed distribution of projects regionally.\n  - Equal emphasis will be given to all projects, with focus on bankability rather than a particular trade/activity.\n  - The borrowers under the scheme will be monitored at the district level by an Implementation Committee headed by the Deputy Commissioner, with members drawn from the various departments. Extension of support to the beneficiaries will be provided by the respective departments. The scheme will involve active participation of the banks and the district machinery to transfer the benefits of the subsidy assistance while creating sustainable livelihoods.\n  - The application will be scrutinized by the concerned Bank Branch, and where required, the technical inputs from Nodal Department may be sought for finalizing the beneficiaries seeking capital-subsidy, that too only in cases where loan amount is above 10 Lakhs. For all other categories of beneficiaries, banks shall do the due diligence.\n  - The banks shall disburse the entire approved loan and subsidy. The subsidy shall be back-ended and disbursed through the banks.

Loans approved under CMMFI shall not be treated as KCC for the purpose of interest subvention as a 6-month moratorium period is already there.\n  - In case of KCC loan and agriculture infrastructure loans, proposed for subsidy under CMMFI, for loans above 1.6 Lakh, respective VDBs may undertake to provide Credit Guarantee Fund from their fixed deposits. In case of NSRLM SHGs, respective Cluster/Block Level Federations may undertake to provide Credit Guarantee Fund from their Community Investment Support Fund. Bank loan for KCC will be determined as per the scale of finance published by NABARD.
