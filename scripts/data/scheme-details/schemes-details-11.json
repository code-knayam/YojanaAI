The mandate of the proposed scheme is to strengthen new and existing CR Stations with resources, capacity and technology, to promote growth of CRS, especially in remote and rural areas and to promote socio-economic and cultural development of communities as CRS is a powerful medium for social mobilization.

Increase in milk production thereby providing more economic gains to the farmers.\n   1. To reduce the inter-calving period which will ultimately result in more calves and higher milk production.\n   1. To improve the health of pregnant cows so that their full milk production potential can be realized after parturition.\n   1.

Under this scheme, balanced ration @ 3kg/day/cow or buffalo for maximum of two animals for three months during the last trimester of pregnancy at 50% subsidy of BPL families belonging to the Scheduled Caste category may be provided.\n**Objectives:**\n\n   1. Increase in milk production thereby providing more economic gains to the farmers.\n   1. To reduce the inter-calving period which will ultimately result in more calves and higher milk production.\n   1. To improve the health of pregnant cows &amp;amp; buffaloes so that their full milk production potential can be realized after parturition.\n   1. To ensure the birth of healthy calves free of diseases and malnutrition so that they grow to become higher-producing animals.\n   1. As the incentive is being given to Desi/Indigenous cows and buffaloes, the farmers can be motivated to rear such animals.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n- A balanced ration will be provided @ 3kg/day/cow for three months (last trimester of pregnancy).\n- The cost will be shared by the Government and beneficiary on a 50:50 basis.\n- The cost of feed will depend upon the tender/approved rates.\n\n",
