The project focuses on the evidence-based scientific implementation of this plan.\n<br>\n\nThe project has introduced transformational changes in the agriculture sector by scaling up the adoption of climate-smart technologies and practices at the farm and micro-watershed level, contributing to drought-proofing and creation of new opportunities in villages worst hit by drought and salinity/sodicity affected villages in the state. The project is supporting investments by farmers, farmers’ collectives, and communities for accessing water, optimal utilization of natural resources, value addition of agriculture commodities, and adoption of climate-resilient agriculture technologies. The project has taken a gender-sensitive approach to prioritize the needs of the women stakeholders in the planning and implementation of project interventions which is being driven through “Krushi Tais” (female mobilizers) at the village level.\n<br>\n\nDirect Benefit Transfer portal and mobile application allow farmers to apply for matching grants for their farm-level investments aimed at improving incomes. The DBT portal is a workflow-based end to end online system through which the project officials can verify the eligibility and assets created and transfer the matching grants directly to the farmer’s Aadhar linked bank account.

        "detailedDescription_md": "Telecommunication technology products require significantly large funding and long gestation periods for R&amp;amp;D and commercialization including the additional efforts and resources for the products to move from prototype to commercial grade. In the cases of high-impact deep-tech projects, elaborated in later sections, there is a need for higher funding to build such products at an affordable cost to enable state of the art services for rural areas in the country. Taking note of this strategic need in the telecom sector and to create a large pool of capital available for R&amp;amp;D in the country, different financing instruments are offered under various schemes of the Government of India to develop indigenous technologies and solutions. \nApart from the existing R&amp;amp;D funding mechanisms, annual collections under the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) will also be utilized by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for funding research and development of technologies, products, and services for the purpose of providing telecom services in rural and remote areas. An allocation of 5% of annual collections from USOF will be available for funding R&amp;amp;D in the Telecom sector, starting with the funds collected in the financial year 2021-22. Commercialization and adoption of these telecom technologies and solutions developed shall be given priority including through USOF schemes. Induction of new technology developments in the telecom sector in rural and remote areas through pilots and trials.\nDeliverables are in line with the objectives, scope, and activities envisaged above. The impact of the Scheme would be measured in terms of:\n\n1. Number of products, solutions, Use cases developed, commercialized and its market value;\n1. Number of entities received educational order, culminating in getting full-fledged orders; and\n1. Number of IPs generated and commercialized.\n\n",

The objectives are, inter alia, to promote:\n\n   1. Technology Ownership and indigenous Manufacturing (Atmanirbhar Bharat) &amp;amp; reduce import and open up export opportunities;\n   1. Proliferation of next-generation Telecom technologies in Rural and Remote areas;\n   1. Creating a culture of Technology co-creation and co-innovation;\n   1. Promote the ecosystem for research, design, prototyping, development, proof of concept testing, IPR creation, field testing, security, certification, and manufacturing of telecom products, end-to-end Solutions, Usecases, Pilots, inter alia; develop and establish relevant standards to meet national requirements and enable their standardization in international standardization bodies;\n   1. Promote rural-specific communication technology application/use case development that caters to the needs of rural masses and adds value to their day-to-day activities both economic and social;\n   1. Create synergies among the Academia, Research Institutes, Start-ups, and Industry for capacity building and development of the telecom ecosystem through outreach to build rural/remote areas relevant technologies and solutions;\n   1. Bridge the gap between R&amp;amp;D and commercialization of products and solutions;\n   1. Enable proliferation of affordable broadband and mobile services;\n   1. Enable technology demonstration, product integration, pilots, and field trials of the products and solutions;\n   1. Enable Technological/business model innovation in solutions and services by utilizing existing infrastructure of USOF/DoT/GoI funded projects; or\n   1.

When an Indian Company receives a grant under the scheme, it is envisaged to retain its status as a ‘Domestic Company’ for a minimum period of two (2) years after completion of the project to enable the percolation of public funded R&amp;amp;D benefits into the ecosystem.\n   1. If a foreign investor1 or foreign Successor-in-Interest wishes to acquire a majority stake, within the above two-year period, the company can do so, by paying twice the grant principal amount received directly or through a partnership with academia/research institution under the scheme.\n\n",

It is a national Ration Card portability scheme to ensure food security for all including internal migrants within India. It enables migrant workers and their family members to access PDS benefits from any Fair Price Shop anywhere in the country, thus ensuring the food security through the inter-state portability of ration cards under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA). A Fair Price Shop (FPS) is a public ration store licensed under Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act of 1955. Ration card details and entitlements are available online on any ePoS device in the country. It includes both inter-State and intra-State (inter-district/intra-district) portability of ration cards.\nAssam is the 36th State to implement the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) scheme. The ONORC plan has successfully been implemented in all 36 States/UTs making food security portable throughout the country. The government has launched a mobile app, namely ‘**MERA RATION**’ for acquiring the maximum benefit of the ONORC plan. The mobile app shall provide the user with real-time information. It is available in 13 languages. As per the official website of [**National Food Security Portal**](https://nfsa.gov.in/), there are more than 20 crores Ration Cards issued through more than 4.5 lakh POS enabled Fair Price Shops.\n",
        "benefits_md": "\n- It will benefit approximately 81 crores beneficiaries by digitizing Ration Cards.\n- This system allows all NFSA beneficiaries, particularly migrant beneficiaries, to claim either full or part food grains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) in the country through an existing ration card with biometric/Aadhaar authentication in a seamless manner. \n- With the ONORC, all the beneficiaries in one state can get the same fair rations in other states where the ration card was issued.\n- The scheme will ensure food security of migrant laborers who move to other states to seek better job opportunities.\n- It will improve the mechanism to identify fake/duplicate ration cards. It seeks to provide universal access to PDS food grains for migrant workers.\n- Ration card portability will be achieved by implementing an IT-driven system that installs ePoS devices in each Fair Price Shop (FPS).\n- The **ONORC** will also help achieve the target set under **SDG 2**: Ending hunger by 2030.\n",
