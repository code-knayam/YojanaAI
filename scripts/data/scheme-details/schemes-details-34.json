This Establishment of Regional Semen Station will be based on the Expression of Interest from the States in the said Region which can produce semen and supply semen for the states at the region. Also the regional semen station will work as regional semen bank for frozen semen for goat. The semen labs will need to adhere to the guidelines of Minimum standard protocols for semen processing while preparing the project proposals.
