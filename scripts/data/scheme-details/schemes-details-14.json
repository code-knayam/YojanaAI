The problems of unwed mothers are linked with various socio-economic and cultural variables. In Kerala, this problem is coupled with the ignorance and exploitation of the backward classes. It has been pointed out that there are many women in Wayanad and other districts of Kerala who are victims of social exploitation and atrocities and are often forced to become unmarried mothers. Unwed mothers have a special need for education, employment, and health care especially reproductive and child health. Quite often they are neglected from the mainstream of life. The percentage of abortion-related hazards and death is high among teenage unwed mothers.\n             As a part of this scheme, the Government is giving ₹1000/- per month to them. One curious fact that can be noted is that the women who are exploited never blame the person who caused their misery, largely due to their style of living. At a young age, they long for love and care. Their husbands do not stay with them for long. They go in search of jobs and sometimes do not come back. Their place is taken up by someone else whom these women believe in. Therefore, their condition becomes pathetic and it becomes necessary to address their problems too.\n",

To provide equal educational opportunities to differently-abled persons in higher education institutions.\n1. To create awareness among the functionaries of higher education about the specific educational needs of differently-abled persons. \n1. To equip higher education institutions with the facilities to provide access to differently-abled persons.\n1. To provide special devices to higher education institutions that will augment the learning experiences of differently-abled persons. \n1. To monitor the implementation of all existing and future legislation and policies, which are about higher education of differently-abled persons. \n\n",
        "benefits_md": "**Provision of Facilities and Financial assistance** \nThe HEPSN scheme has three components. They are enumerated as follows: \n> **Component 1: Establishment of Enabling Units for differently-abled Persons** \n\nTo develop awareness in the higher education system and also to provide necessary guidance and counseling to differently-abled persons, it is proposed to establish resource units in colleges in the country, which will be called Enabling Units. The functions of this Enabling Unit will be to: \n1. Facilitate admission of differently-abled persons in various courses; \n2. Provide guidance and counseling to differently-abled individuals; \n3. Create awareness about the needs of differently-abled persons, and other general issues concerning their learning; and \n4. Assist differently-abled graduates to gain successful employment in the public as well as private sectors. \nThe special unit will be coordinated by a faculty member to be nominated by the head of the institution. He/she will work as an honorary coordinator for which a token honorarium of Rs. 4000/- per month will be paid. The unit will also have a budgetary provision of ₹ 50,000/per year towards general administration, stationery, and contingencies, and to avail the services of experts and personnel for organizing awareness programs, counseling sessions, etc., for efficient and independent functioning in order to achieve its objectives.\n<br>\n\n> **Component 2: Providing Access to Differently-abled Persons**\n\n\n1. The UGC will make a one-time grant of up to ₹ 5,00,000 per college during the Plan period so that the colleges can address the accessibility issues pertaining to disability and make special arrangements in the environment for their mobility and independent functioning.\n1. The colleges address accessibility-related issues as per the stipulations of the Persons with Disabilities Act 1995.\n1. The colleges ensure that all existing structures as well as future construction projects in their campuses are made disabled-friendly. \n1. The institutes create special facilities such as ramps, rails, and special toilets, and make other necessary changes to suit the special needs of differently-abled persons.\n\n<br>\n\n> **Component 3: Providing Special Equipment to Augment Educational Services for Differently-abled Persons** \n\nDifferently-abled persons require special aids and appliances for their daily functioning. These aids are available through various schemes of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. In addition to the procurement of assistive devices through these schemes, higher education institutions may also need special learning and assessment devices to help differently-abled students enrolled in higher education. In addition, visually challenged students need Readers. Availability of devices such as computers with screen reading software, low-vision aids, scanners, mobility devices, etc., in the institutes, would enrich the educational experiences of differently-abled persons. Therefore, colleges are encouraged to procure such devices and provide the facility of Readers for visually challenged students. The UGC will provide an ad hoc one-time grant of up to ₹1,50,000  per college during the Twelfth Plan period\n",

In border areas, the provision of essential infrastructure facilities and opportunities for sustainable living would help integrate these areas with the hinterland, create a positive perception of care by the country and encourage people to stay on in the border areas, leading to safe and secure borders.\n<br>\n\nThe following basic principles will guide the implementation of the BADP: \na) Projects for developing infrastructure in strategically important villages/towns (as identified by Border Guarding Forces) will be given priority. \nb) Border Guarding Forces (BGFs) will be co-opted as part of the decision making process at all levels (Planning/ Execution / Monitoring). \nc) Keeping in view the limited availability of funds under BADS, the State/UT Level Screening Committee (SLSC/UTLSC) will ensure convergence with schemes of line Ministries and State/UT Governments and other available resources to ensure holistic development of the strategically important villages/ towns in the border areas. \nd) MHA will work in close collaboration with, inter-alia, M/o Agriculture &amp; Farmers Welfare, M/o DoNER, M/o Health &amp; Family Welfare, M/o Human Resource Development, M/o Jai Shakti, M/o New and Renewable Energy, M/o Power, M/o Rural Development, M/o Skill Development &amp; Entrepreneurship, M/o MSME, M/o Women &amp; Child Development, M/o Youth Affairs &amp; Sports etc. to promote infrastructure development, improved connectivity, better social services and to provide sustainable livelihood opportunities in the border areas. \ne) Works/projects will be evaluated regularly through Social Audit mechanism, besides Prabhari Officers in addition to ongoing mechanisms of State/UT/ Central Governments. \nf) Saturation / coverage through ongoing developmental schemes of various Ministries of Government of India, if necessary, by relaxation of guidelines and yardsticks with the approval of the competent authority. \ng) Medium-Term perspective — Four/Five Year Perspective Action Plan would be prepared for development of identified habitations by pooling resources as mentioned in sub clause (c) above. For the subsequent years, the Annual Plan would be drawn up within the overall perspective plan and inclusive of objectives carried forward, modifications necessitated due to lessons learnt and other developments. The Annual Plans would be a subset of the same. For the first year, along with a prospective plan, an annual plan would also be submitted. The States would strive to achieve saturation of beneficiaries and creation of infrastructure under various Government Schemes by 2023. \nh) Competition among Districts: The Districts would be challenged to compete among themselves on the basis of incremental changes and their performance would be recognized and rewarded. \ni) Comprehensive Development: For comprehensive development of border districts, BADP will have two components - first will be saturation of beneficiaries and ensuring creation of infrastructure in border districts through convergence of various Government Schemes, and second part will be Border Area Development Scheme(BADS) for convergence and filling up gaps to achieve desired levels of development.\n<br>\n\n"
