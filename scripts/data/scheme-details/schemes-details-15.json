The mission has initiated this scheme that aims at bringing these children to the mainstream of society.\n            The statistics reveal that in Kerala, around 75,000 children below 18 years are living in orphanages. Around 1500 orphanages are functioning in Kerala. Almost 80- 90% of the children in orphanages have families and relatives. Many orphans and vulnerable children slip further into poverty once the family’s main breadwinner stops working or dies. There is nothing more traumatic for a child than to see a parent die. Added to this tragedy is the loss of adult guidance and protection. Children without proper adult care are more likely to be abused &amp;amp; exploited.\n            Children in this category include orphans, abandoned children, children who have lost their parents in war, communal riots, natural disasters, accidents, etc. They are not properly fed; they have no shelter, nutritious food, health care, education, or any recreation. Most of them are facing economic and social exploitation. They are deprived of the love and affection of the family and are often unwanted by family members.\n**Objectives of the Scheme:**\n\n   1. To identify the orphaned children in the community.\n   1. To assess and prioritize children in the greatest need.\n   1. To provide social protection to highly vulnerable groups of orphans by strengthening traditional family and community systems for protecting and absorbing orphans.\n   1. To improve the basic education, social integration, and nutrition of the most vulnerable groups of orphans towards the levels of other children in the community.\n   1. To encourage families to live their children within the family setup rather than sending them to orphanages.\n   1. To extend a helping hand to these orphan families by way of providing financial assistance for the education of children.\n\n",

Pursuant to this announcement, a Central Sector Scheme titled the “SFURTI\".",
        "detailedDescription_md": "“Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI)” is a programme of the Ministry of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises, Government of India and was launched in the year 2005 with the view to make the traditional industries more competitive, market-driven, productive, profitable and capable of providing sustainable employment for traditional industry artisans and rural entrepreneurs. The Coir Board is the Nodal Agency for the implementation of the scheme. The scheme is being implemented by the Board through the Implementing Agencies engaged by the Board for each cluster. This scheme focuses on physical infrastructure creation, technology upgradation, training, product development, innovation, design interventions, marketability, improved packaging and marketing infrastructure with the aim of improving artisanal income.\n&gt; **Objectives of the Scheme:**\n\n\n   1. To organize the traditional industries and artisans into collectives to make them competitive and provide support for their long-term sustainability and economy of scale.\n   1. To provide sustained employment for traditional industry artisans and producers.\n   1. To enhance the marketability of products of such clusters and collectives by providing support for new products, design intervention and improved packaging and also the improvement of marketing infrastructure.\n   1. To equip traditional artisans and producers of the associated clusters with improved skills and capabilities through training and exposure visits.\n   1. To promote collective business enterprises of traditional artisans and producers.\n   1. To make provision for common facilities and improved tools and equipment for artisans and producers to promote optimum utilization of infrastructure facilities.\n   1. To provide for the setting up of a multi-product cluster with an integrated value chain and a strong market-driven approach for viability and long-term sustainability of the cluster.\n   1. To strengthen the cluster governance systems with the active participation of the stakeholders, so that they are able to gauge the emerging challenges and opportunities, respond to them in a coherent manner and ensure equitable distribution of surplus generated by the collective among all the artisans and producers.\n   1. To promote traditional skills, improved technologies, advanced processes, market intelligence and new models of public-private partnerships, to gradually replicate similar models of collective/cluster-based traditional industries.\n   1.

To ensure convergence from the design stage with each activity of the cluster formation and operations thereof.\n   1. To identify and understand the collective/cluster&amp;#39;s target customers, understand their needs and aspirations and develop the present product lines to meet the requirements. Substantial focus should be on the buyer segment that places a premium on natural, eco-friendly, ethically sourced and the uniqueness of the Khadi and Village and Industries products.\n   1. To develop specific product lines out of the currently offered diversified basket of heterogeneous products based on the understanding of the target consumer segment. A brand unification exercise also needs to be done to maximize the value.\n   1. To make a paradigm shift from a supply-driven selling model to a market-driven model with the right branding, focus product mix and correct positioning and right pricing to make the offering holistic and optimal for each of the focus categories.\n   1. To tap E-Commerce as a major marketing channel and devise a quick strategy to make its presence felt in the E-Retail space.\n   1. To make substantial investments in the area of product design and quality improvement, Research and Development and emerging technologies based on the market trends with an eye to standardizing the quality of inputs and processes so that the products meet the quality benchmarks.\n   1.

The scheme mainly focuses on enhancing water use efficiency at the farm level through Micro Irrigation (Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation System). Besides, it also supports micro-level water storage, and water conservation/management activities (Other Interventions) to supplement source creation for Micro Irrigation.\n**Objectives:**\n\n  - Increase the area under micro irrigation technologies to enhance water use efficiency in the country.\n  - Increase the productivity of crops and income of farmers through precision water management.\n  - Promote micro-irrigation technologies in water-intensive/consuming crops like sugarcane, banana, cotton, etc., and give adequate focus to extend the coverage of field crops under micro-irrigation technologies.\n  - Make potential use of micro irrigation systems for promoting fertigation.\n  - Promote micro-irrigation technologies in water-scarce, water-stressed, and critical groundwater blocks/districts.\n  - Link tube-well / river-lift irrigation projects with micro irrigation technologies for the best use of energy both for lifting and pressurized irrigation as far as possible.\n  - Establish convergence and synergy with activities of ongoing programmes and schemes, particularly with created water sources for their potential use, integration of solar energy for pressurized irrigation, etc.\n  - Promote, develop, and disseminate micro irrigation technology for agriculture and horticulture development with modern scientific knowledge.\n  - Create employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled persons, especially unemployed youth for installation and maintenance of micro irrigation systems.\n\n**Important Features:**\n\n  - Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) not only focuses on creating water sources for assured irrigation, but it also creating protective irrigation by harnessing rainwater at the micro level through ‘Jal Sanchay’ and ‘Jal Sinchan’. Micro irrigation is an integral component of the scheme to maximize water use efficiency at the farm level.\n  - There are four components to the scheme: Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP), Per Drop More Crop (PDMC), Har Khet Ko Pani, and Watershed Development \n  - Per Drop More Crop: to focus on micro-level storage structures, efficient water conveyance &amp;amp; application, precision irrigation systems, topping up of input cost beyond MGNREGA permissible limits, secondary storage, water lifting devices, extension activities, coordination &amp;amp; management - being implemented by DAC&amp;amp;FW.\n\n**Nodal Department:** \n\n  - Since the final outcome of PMKSY is to ensure access to efficient delivery and application of water at every farm thereby enhancing agricultural production &amp;amp; productivity, State Agriculture Department may be the Nodal Department for implementation of PMKSY (Per Drop More Crop). However, State Govt. is free to identify the nodal department based on the established institutional setup and mandate of the department. All communication between the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and the State Government would be preferable with and through the nodal department. \n  - States are free to identify dedicated implementing agencies/departments for the implementation of Per Drop More Crop.\n\n",
        "benefits_md": "\n- Financial assistance to farmers for the installation of irrigation components under Micro Irrigation (all assets/ water sources for this must be mandatorily linked with a Micro Irrigation system to achieve water use efficiency).\n- Installation of drip or sprinkler irrigation in the farmers’ field for selected crops.\n- Installation of the irrigation system can be done either by the farmers themselves or by the selection of any approved Micro Irrigation companies.\n- The pattern of assistance payable to the beneficiary under the micro irrigation scheme will be 55% for small and marginal farmers and 45% for other farmers which will be met by both the Central Government and State Government in the ratio of 60:40 for all states except the North Eastern and Himalayan states. In the case of these states, the ratio of sharing is 90:10. For the Union Territories, the funding pattern is 100% granted by the Central Government.\n- Direct Benefit Transfer into the accounts of farmers.\n- Farmers can also avail benefits like water harvesting structures both at individual and community levels, water lifting devices for conveyance efficiency, and digging of a farm pond, under Other Interventions of Per Drop More Crop.\n\n",

Though there is no dowry system prevalent in Assam, the parent of every girl desires to give something to the girl during her marriage. The parents, irrespective of their social and economic status dream to bestow their children with love, blessings and gifts. But for many, these dreams remain unfulfilled due to their economic weakness. \nGold is always considered auspicious and an asset. The parents believe that a gift of gold ornament would enhance their daughter’s social and economic status. Objective: The Government of Assam has decided to introduce a New Scheme “ARUNDHATI” from the financial year 2019-20. \nThe objective of the scheme is to facilitate the parents of the girl child who are economically not very sound, but like all parents desire to give some gold which is considered auspicious to their as gift daughters on her marriage. The Government desires to share the joy of such parents who are getting their daughters married by way of providing Rs. 40,000/- as a blessing to the daughters of these parents for purchasing Gold. \n"
