        "detailedDescription_md": "Prevalence of suitable agro climate has led to natural occurrence of a large number of flowering species in Assam having aesthetic value and horticultural importance. Existence of an ornamental garden is a tradition and characteristic feature of every household in Assam. From time immemorial, the State has been endowed with a rich diversity of flowering annuals and perennials, bulbous ornamental, amazing creepers, ferns and foliage and awesome orchids. In orchid alone, Assam is credited with the natural occurrence of 191 splendid species having diversified forms and wide colour range. Contrary to the potential and scope of commercialization, the State floriculture even till today, is largely confined to household garden as a part of hobby horticulture. The number of commercial pockets can be counted on fingers. Although, the State floriculture sector has shown some amount of growth under the impact of government sponsored development projects like HMNEH, the net position of the State in the National Floriculture Map is yet to be visible. Today, Assam registers an area of 1800 ha under total floriculture which is less than 1% of the total area under floriculture in the country and 7.8% of the total area under floriculture in the neighboring West Bengal.\n<br>\n\nIt is further observed that even the neighboring states like West Bengal has a pride position in terms of area and production of flower crops eventually finding its way to the markets in Assam. Today, the incoming flower basket from West Bengal has virtually captured the State&#39;s flower market primarily due to low internal production and lack of consistency in supply as per desired volumes. According to unofficial estimates, the annual inflow of flowers to the State&#39;s flower market hovers around Rs. 7-8 crores paving out outflow of State&#39;s revenue in substantial quantum.\nIt is now well accepted that in order to sustain agriculture as a profitable venture, due attention must be paid to selection of high value crop options that fetch higher return on investment per unit area. It has been an established fact that as a potential component of horticultural sector, the floriculture based enterprises can provide significantly higher net return to farmers compared to other agricultural production options due to their higher market prices resulting from uniqueness, diversified uses and fascination on part of higher income group.\n<br>\n\n",

Shortage of specialist doctors, especially the gynecologists, anesthetists and pediatricians at Taluk hospitals and CHCs, The posts of these specialists are mostly vacant in Government Hospitals.\nii. Though there are very large number of government health care institutions in the state, the shortage of these specialists is a big draw back in providing proper maternal and child health care.\niii.There are considerable number of specialist doctors in urban private hospitals.\niv. By entering into Public-Private partnership with these hospitals, rural women can be provided with facilities for proper institutional deliveries.\n<br>\n\nThe hospitals having requisite facilities will be registered under the programme with the approval of District Health Society. The Hospitals will then sign an MOU with the Department. Government Hospitals can also participate in this scheme.\n<br>\n\nSuch registered hospitals will be paid Rs. 3.00 lakhs per 100 deliveries, which include normal delivery, complicated deliveries, caesarian, forceps deliveries etc. These hospitals will be paid 10% ie., Rs.30,000 advance on participation in the scheme. This is to encourage more and more private hospitals to participate in the programme.\nThe Government Hospitals will be paid Rs. 1.50 lakhs for every 100 deliveries, out of which 50,000 goes to the Health Care Committee and the remaining is shared among the Hospital doctors, nurses and staff as per Yeshaswini guidelines.​\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n"

Despite these advancements, much headway could not be made in-home care. Most of the lowest income group always opt for homely treatment as they cannot afford the charges levied by the well-known hospitals. They are bedridden causing a heavy social burden on their family members who are forced to stay back at home to look after these bedridden patients. While the upper-income group can possibly afford to engage paid caregivers or home nurses for looking after such bedridden family members, the lower-income group usually take it upon themselves to care for their bedridden brethren. These family members in fact function as informal caregivers, without due recognition or economic gain.\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n**Coverage Of Diseases** \n●\tAll bed-ridden patients who need a full-time caregiver.\n●\tMentally challenged (Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental retardation, Mental illness).\n●\t100 % blind, bed-ridden cancer patients, old-aged bed-ridden.\n●\tBrittle bone disease.\n"

Under the scheme, financial assistance is provided to women of Below Poverty Line (BPL) families to find self-employment, whose husbands have died/abandoned, and who have to take care of their sons/children with severe physical and mental challenges.\nParents of severely mentally retarded and differently-abled persons require emotional strength and flexibility. Older parents can find themselves overwhelmed by various medical, caregiving, and financial responsibilities. Physically Handicapped/Mentally Retarded (PH/MR) persons always need special care and attention since they cannot perform their day-to-day activities without someone else’s assistance. Sometimes it can be quite challenging for older parents in BPL families, especially mothers, who have to take care of household tasks and work apart from taking care of MR persons.\nLooking after such a Mentally challenged/PH person is expensive. These expenses can arise from medical equipment and supplies, medical care, caregiving expenses, specialized transportation, etc. Even though an amount of ₹600/- is being provided as “Aswasakiranam Pension” to caregivers (family members) of bedridden PH/MR persons, it cannot cover the expenses completely. Single mothers face tremendous challenges. Often, a custodial parent must fulfill the roles of primary provider and caregiver without the benefit of a partner. It is a difficult task under the best of circumstances.\n",

        "detailedDescription_md": "The government of Telangana formulated the double bed room housing scheme in the month of October 2015 with a view to providing dignity to the poor by providing 100% subsidized housing. There is no beneficiary contribution under this scheme which is one of its kind. In rural areas, beneficiaries solely depend on seasonal conditions for their earnings, the 2BHK housing helped in protecting them from debt traps as was the case in the past.\n<br>\n\nHitherto the old yardstick was to provide a 260 sqft house with a single room; The &quot;Double Bedroom Housing&quot; provides two bedrooms, a hall, a kitchen and two toilets covering the 560 Sqft plinth area. The plot area is 125 sq yards for an independent house in a rural area and worked out to 36 Sq yards of undivided land share in G++ pattern houses in urban areas. The land is thus provided free of cost apart from the cost of the dwelling unit.\n<br>\n\nThis is perhaps the only State in the Country to launch such a liberal scheme for the poor. Under this scheme, the beneficiaries neither take a loan nor contribute which is a great boon for rural and urban poor families, for acquiring a dwelling unit. It is a paradigm shift from a credit and subsidy-based scheme to a &quot;fully subsidized scheme&quot; which creates a sound economic asset with a hygienic living environment for the beneficiary, there by contributing enormously to the socio-economic growth of the individual and as well as the community.\n"

        "detailedDescription_md": "The KCC Scheme was introduced with the objective of providing adequate and timely credit to the farmers for their agricultural operations. The Government of India provides interest subvention of 2% and Prompt Repayment Incentive of 3% to the farmers, thus making the credit available at a very subsidized rate of 4% per annum. \nThe scheme was further extended for the investment credit requirement of farmers viz. allied and non-farm activities in the year 2004 and further revisited in 2012 by a working Group under the Chairmanship of Shri T. M. Bhasin, CMD, Indian Bank with a view to simplify the scheme and facilitate issue of Electronic Kisan Credit Cards. The scheme provides broad guidelines to banks for operationalizing the KCC scheme. Implementing banks will have the discretion to adopt the same to suit institution/location-specific requirements.\n<br>\n\n**Objective / Purpose**\nThe Kisan Credit Card scheme aims at providing adequate and timely credit support from the banking system under a single window with the flexible and simplified procedures to the farmers for their cultivation and other needs as indicated below :\n\n1. To meet the short term credit requirements for the cultivation of crops;\n1. Post-harvest expenses;\n1. Produce marketing loan;\n1. Consumption requirements of farmer household;\n1. Working capital for maintenance of farm assets and activities allied to agriculture;\n1. Investment credit requirement for agriculture and allied activities\n\n<br>\n\n**Type of Card** \n\n- A magnetic stripe card with PIN (Personal Identification Number) with an ISO IIN (International Standards Organization International Identification Number) to enable access to all banks ATMs and micro ATMs\n- In cases where the Banks would want to utilize the centralized biometric authentication infrastructure of the UIDAI (Aadhaar authentication), debit cards with magnetic stripe and PIN with ISO IIN with biometric authentication of UIDAI can be provided.\n- Debit Cards with magnetic stripes and only biometric authentication can also be provided depending on the customer base of the bank. Till such time, UIDAI becomes widespread, if the banks want to get started without inter-operability using their existing centralized bio metric infrastructure, banks may do so.\n- Banks may choose to issue EMV (Europay, MasterCard and VISA, a global standard for the interoperation of integrated circuit cards) and RUPAY compliant chip cards with magnetic stripe and pin with ISO IIN.\n- Further, biometric authentication and smart cards may follow the common open standards prescribed by IDRBT and IBA. This will enable them to transact seamlessly with input dealers and also enable them to have the sales proceeds credited to their accounts when they sell their output at mandies, procurement centres, etc\n\n<br>\n\n**Delivery Channels :**\nThe following delivery channels shall be put in place to start with so that the Kisan Credit Card is used by the farmers to effectively transact their operations in their KCC account. \n\n1. Withdrawal through ATMs / Micro ATM\n1. Withdrawal through BCs using smart cards.\n1. PoS machine through input dealers\n1. Mobile Banking with IMPS capabilities / IVR\n1. Aadhaar enabled Cards\n\n"
