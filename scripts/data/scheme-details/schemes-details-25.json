Rampur Bushari and Gaddi breeds of Himachal Pradesh are famous for indigenous carpet wool production in the Country. The total sheep population in the State is 8.05 lakh. As per norms, one breeding ram is required per 20-25 sheep. It is expected that a breedable population of approximately 3 lakh sheeps may require at least 12,000 rams in the state. \n**Aim of this scheme:**\n\n   1. provide High Genetic Merit breeding rams of Rambouillet and Russian Merino breeds and \n   1. after purchasing from Farms/progressive breeders of the state and neighboring States and \n   1. to provide these to sheep breeders at 60% subsidy.\n\n**Objective of the scheme:**\n\n   1. To improve Quality and Quantity of Wool being produced in the state, thereby ensuring better economic returns to the Sheep Breeders.\n   1. Genetic improvement of indigenous Sheep breeds and dissemination of Superior Germplasm amongst the migratory flocks of sheep in the state.\n   1. To resolve the problem of inbreeding amongst the migratory sheep flocks of Tribal Sheep Breeders.\n\n**Key features:**\n\n   1. **Subsidized Rams:** The scheme provides rams of superior breeds at subsidized rates to eligible sheep breeders.   1. **Superior Breeds:** The rams provided under the scheme are of superior breeds such as Merino, Rambouillet, and Hampshire.\n**Note:** This scheme is for all the sheep breeders who want to adopt modern and scientific methods of sheep breeding.
