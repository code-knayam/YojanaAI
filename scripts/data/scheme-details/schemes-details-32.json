This technique is very useful for off-season cultivation of vegetables in the plains of North India where the night temperature remains below 8 degrees Celsius for about 40 to 60 days during the winter season. This technique allows off-season vegetable cultivation. Vegetable seedlings are prepared using the plastic tray technique specifically in December and January.\n<br>\n\n> **Important points**\n\n\n1.
