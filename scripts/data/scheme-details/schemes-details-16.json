The scheme provides financial assistance of Rs. 10 lakhs to eligible SC families to start their own businesses or entrepreneurial ventures, thereby creating opportunities for them to become self-reliant and improve their standard of living._\n<br>\n\nAs a part of a multi-pronged approach, in addition to existing entitlements like food security, education, and social security, a different strategy with a new initiative &quot;Telangana Dalit Bandhu&quot; is introduced to intensify the level of financial assistance to SC households for the establishment of suitable income generating economic support schemes as the delivery of credit by banks in the form of loans has become a constraint.\n<br>\n\nUnder the scheme, eligible families will receive financial assistance of Rs. 10 lakhs each, in the form of a grant, to start a small business or entrepreneurial venture. The scheme is expected to benefit over 20 lakh families in the state over the next few years. One-time capital assistance of Rs.10 lakhs per SC family is provided for all SC families as a 100% grant/subsidy to establish suitable income-generating schemes as per their choice (without bank loan linkage).\n<br>\n\nThe main objective of the scheme is to reduce poverty and promote entrepreneurship among the SC community, which has historically been marginalized and faced discrimination in society. The scheme is also expected to promote inclusive growth and social development in the state. \n<br>\n\nThe Telangana government has allocated Rs. 1,000 crores for the implementation of the scheme in the first year. The scheme is expected to be implemented in a phased manner, with eligible families being identified and selected based on a set of criteria such as income level, educational qualification, and entrepreneurial skills.\n<br>\n\n***Overall, the Dalit Bandhu Scheme is a path-breaking initiative that aims to uplift the socio-economic status of the SC community in Telangana. The scheme provides a much-needed boost to entrepreneurship and economic development among the marginalized sections of society, thereby promoting inclusive growth and social development in the state.***\n"

This scheme has been in operation since 2003 and has enrolled 1,09,534 workers from 19 unorganized sectors and 17 self-employment occupations until September 2019. The scheme is aimed at helping wage-employed and self-employed workers between the ages of 21 and 60 years who work in unorganized sectors and have an average family income of not more than Rs. 10,000 per month.\n<br>\n\nUnder the ASSP scheme, each subscriber (worker) is required to contribute a sum of Rs. 50/- per month, and the State Government also contributes an equal matching amount of Rs. 50/- per month. The State Government/Bank pays interest on the balance at credit of a subscriber annually at the rate declared by the Government.\n<br>\n\nThe total contribution, along with interest as declared from time to time, will be refunded to the workers on attaining the age of 60 years, or in the event of the account becoming inoperative due to death or permanent total disability due to accident or loss of two eyes or two limbs or loss of one eye or one limb in an accident or prolonged default in making contributions. \n<br>\n\nIn summary, the ASSP scheme provides a financial safety net for unorganized workers in Tripura. Eligible workers can enroll by paying a monthly contribution of Rs. 50, which is matched by the State Government. The contributions earn interest, and the total amount, including interest, is refunded to the workers when they reach the age of 60 years, or in the event of the account becoming inoperative due to certain circumstances. \n"

The difficulty is being faced to increase the use of Hindi in official work due to scarcity of books in Hindi on the subjects based on technology, science, forensic science, police, criminology research, police administration, culture, religion, arts, heritage and in the field of law. In addition, employees do face difficulties in doing their official work in Hindi as they are less acquainted or non-acquainted with Hindi terminologies of these subjects. The Department of Official Language is undertaking this scheme with the sole objective to encourage writing books in Hindi on the above-mentioned subjects. \n(B) Various Ministries/Departments have undertaken different award schemes related to Hindi at the national level. Department of Official Language has been made the sole Nodal Department for book schemes related to Hindi. Hence, relevant schemes among the award schemes related to Hindi being run by various Ministries/ Departments at the national level have been incorporated under the scheme. It has been decided to discontinue the other award schemes. If any Ministry/Department, in the future, wishes to undertake any other award scheme related to Hindi it shall mandatorily consult with the Department of Official Language before taking up any such scheme to avoid repetition of the award scheme.\n",
