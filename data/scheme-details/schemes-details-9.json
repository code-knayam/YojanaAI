BMF will also act as the training centre to conduct training for farmers and entrepreneurs.\nThere is no system available in the country for producing disease-free elite animals of indigenous breeds of cattle and buffalo or exotic breeds of cattle. Therefore it is proposed to establish breed multiplication farms through an entrepreneurship model to make available disease-free high-yielding heifers/pregnant heifers /cows preferably of indigenous breeds of cattle/buffaloes in the country. \n&lt;br&gt;\n\n"

All grants under the Scheme will be of a non-recurring nature. Recurring expenditures, if any, will be the responsibility of the grantee organization.\n3. Assistance under the scheme to an organization will be restricted to a maximum of 60% of the approved estimated project cost, subject to the ceilings given above. In the case of projects in the North Eastern Region (NER) [comprises States of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura] the maximum amount of Central financial assistance would be 90% of the total approved project cost subject to the maximum financial ceilings as mentioned above. The balance of the approved estimated project cost is to be incurred by the organization as its ‘matching share’.\nIllustrations:- For projects involving new construction/ purchase of built-up space in metro cities.\n**Case 1:** If the approved cost of the project is ₹100.00 lakhs (in metro cities), the maximum grant which may be sanctioned would be ₹50.00 lakhs, the matching share of the grantee organization being ₹50.00 lakhs.\n**Case 2:** If the approved cost of the project is ₹70.00 lakhs (in metro cities), the maximum grant which may be sanctioned would be ₹42.00 lakhs, the matching share of the grantee organization being ₹28.00 lakhs. In the case of NER projects, the maximum grant which may be sanctioned would be ₹25.00 lakhs, the matching share of the grantee organization being ₹45.00 lakhs.\nFor projects involving new construction/ purchase of built-up space in non-metro cities and all projects under:\n**Case 3:** If the approved cost of the project is ₹60.00 lakhs (in non-metro cities), the maximum grant which may be sanctioned would be ₹25.00 lakhs, the matching share of the grantee organization being ₹35.00 lakhs.\n**Case 4:** If the approved cost of the project is ₹40.00 lakhs (in non-metro cities), the maximum grant which may be sanctioned would be ₹24.00 lakhs, the matching share of the grantee organization being ₹16.00 lakhs. However, in the case of NER, the maximum grant which may be sanctioned would be ₹25.00 lakhs, the matching share of the grantee organization being ₹15.00 lakhs.\n4. Cost of the land (actual consideration paid by the recipient organization and not market value) and development charges borne by the organization shall be accounted as matching shares.\n5. Expenditure already incurred by the organization on construction/ purchase/ development of land &amp;amp; building and purchase of fixtures and fittings within a period of one year from the date of application, shall also be accounted as matching share. The organization will submit accounts of expenditure incurred in this regard duly certified by a Chartered Accountant.\n6. In case the cost of the project is enhanced subsequently, the liability of the Government of India will be restricted to the original sanctioned amount, and all the extra expenditure will be met by the grantee organization from its own resources.\n7. Once the project proposal has been considered and approved for a certain amount, no subsequent requests for review and enhancement of project cost will usually be entertained.\n8. An Undertaking is required to be submitted at the time of submission of the application by the applicant organization to the effect that the project will be completed within a period of three years from the date of release of 1st Installment.\n",

The aim of the National Solar Science Fellowship Programme is to provide a platform to top quality scientists and engineers in the area of solar energy research, to use and expand the resources available at the identified schools/ institutions in the country and abroad to address the complex problems of solar energy utilization for various end uses including power generation.\n**Fellowship Management Committee:** A Fellowship Management Committee will be constituted by the Ministry under the Chairmanship of Secretary, MNRE with eminent scientists as members and scientist-in-charge (HRD) as convener. The Fellowship Management Committee will decide the areas of research to be undertaken under this programme. The Committee will also be recommending the institutions for taking part in the Fellowship Programme. The expert members of the Committee will have a duration of three years.\n**Number of Fellowships:** The total number of Fellowships at any point of time will be limited to 10 only. However, only three fellows will be selected during the first year of the launch of the Programme.\n**Duration of Fellowship:** Duration of the Fellowship will be initially for two years which may be extended for another three years on year to year basis depending upon the progress of the work done by the Fellow.\n**Commencement of Programme:** The National Solar Science Fellows will form a community of researchers engaged in frontal areas of solar energy by intellectual curiosity, top-quality scholarship, and drive to understand and find solutions to the application of solar energy and find solutions to the energy security challenges facing the country today. Through this programme, they will be benefiting from all that the Government has to offer, and in turn, benefit the Government in finding solutions to the technological problems of solar energy and their application on the field leading to the visible impact of solar energy in the energy sector of the country.\n",

The Government of Kerala has implemented this scheme which provides financial assistance for the marriage of the daughters of those who have been undergoing imprisonment for more than 2 years. The maximum amount of financial assistance will be ₹30,000/- per person, during the first phase of the scheme as many as 20 such families will be assisted. \n       When a person commits a crime and gets sentenced to imprisonment, his family is vulnerable to financial instability, poverty, debt, and potential housing disruption. They often get stigmatized and marginalized in society following the incarceration of a family member. Due to the poor financial conditions, the family members find it difficult to ensure proper education for their children and marry off their daughters. Therefore, the Government of Kerala has implemented this scheme for the upliftment of such a target population.\n",

The programme also aims to create awareness among the public about the importance of preserving and protecting the environment.\n<br>\n\nThe program was launched by Telangana Chief Minister Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao on 3 July 2015. It is one of the Telangana Flagship programmes to rejuvenate degraded forests, protecting these forests from threats such as smuggling, encroachment, fire and grazing. It adopted intensive soil and moisture conservation measures based on a watershed approach.\n<br>\n\nIn the areas outside the existing forest, massive planting activities were to be taken up in areas such as; road-side avenues, river and canal banks, barren hills and foreshore areas, institutional premises, religious places, housing colonies, community lands, municipalities and industrial parks.\n<br>\n\nSpecific duties and responsibilities are assigned to different committees to ensure the implementation of the programme in a well-designed way. These committees do regular field inspections and monitor the ongoing plantation and nursery works. The committees are the State-Level Steering Committee and the District-Level Monitoring and Coordination Committee.\n<br>\n\nAt the village level, Haritha Rakshana Committees were formed to monitor the program under the Chairmanship of Gram Sarpanch.\n<br>\n\nThe seedlings are monitored through geo-tagging.

The Proposals can be submitted [online](https://submit.kscste.kerala.gov.in/) only on the notification and during the active time.\n**Note 01:** Proposals under this programme shall be submitted online only. Proposals submitted in any other mode will not be considered and summarily rejected.\n**Note 02:** The Principal Investigator shall also submit an Endorsement from the Implementing Institution, Certificate from the Investigators, Certificate of No pending SE&amp;amp;UC, Resumes of PI and Co-I(s) and Self Appraisal of the PI to execute the project, etc. along with the project proposal (Document formats can be downloaded from the website).\n**Selection procedure:**\n**Stage 1:** **Submission and Evaluation of Pre – Proposal**\n**Step 01: Submission of Pre-Proposal:** Once the call for proposal is notified, the PI has to initially submit the Preproposal for the proposed research fitting into the identified domain themes/sub-themes, as explained above, online.\n**Step 02: Scrutiny of the Pre-proposal:** Upon receiving the pre-proposal, acknowledgement with a reference number will be issued to the PI through email and SMS. The project proposal will be scrutinized thereafter. Complete proposals with all the relevant documents will proceed further for Peer Review and the incomplete proposals will not be processed further and summarily rejected.\n**Step 03:** **Peer Review of Pre-Proposal:** The pre-proposal will be forwarded to 3 subject experts for peer review. The preproposal will be evaluated based on an Evaluation Matrix containing 7 criteria (scores from 5 to 0), as per the following criteria:\t\n0: Fails to address the criteria cannot be evaluated.\n1: Poor: The criterion is inadequately addressed and there are serious inherent weaknesses.\n2: Fair: Broadly addresses the criterion, but there are serious inherent weaknesses.\n3: Good: The proposal addresses the criterion well, but there are several shortcomings.\n4: Very Good: The proposal addresses the criterion well, but a few shortcomings are found.\n5: Excellent: The proposal addresses the criterion well, no shortcomings as such are found.\n**Step 04: Screening Procedure after Scoring:** The reviewers will assign suitable scores based on the review of the pre-proposals. Based on review reports from reviewers, the proposals will be ranked based on the score points. Only 50% of the proposals that secure higher than 60% score points (average of scores by subject experts) will be considered to proceed to the next stage for submitting detailed proposals and others will be rejected. The PIs of the selected proposals will be intimated about the submission of detailed proposals.\n**Stage 2: Submission and Evaluation of Detailed Proposal**\n**Step 01:** **Submission of Detailed Proposal:** The PIs of the selected pre-proposals will be informed to submit the detailed Proposals online within the stipulated time frame.\n**Step 02: Scrutiny and Peer Review:** The detailed Project Proposals will be scrutinized and sent to the referees for peer review. The proposal will be sent to five national-level experts in the concerned field for peer review. Based on the review reports from referees, the recommended proposals will be placed in the Programme Advisory Committee for YIPB (PAC-YIPB) for final decision.\n**Step 03: Presentation before the Programme Advisory Committee (PAC):** The PI/Co-Is will be invited to present the proposal before the PAC. PAC is a high-level Committee comprising of National Level Experts and constituted by KBC. The Council assesses the objectives, scope, content and social relevance of the proposed project and recommends the nature and quantum of assistance to be provided to the approved project. The decision made by KBC based on the recommendations of PAC on such a proposal shall be final.\n**Contact Details:**\nThe Scientist-in-charge\nKerala Biotechnology Commission\nKerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment (KSCSTE),\nSasthra Bhavan, Pattom, Thiruvananthapuram – 695 004\nTelephone: (0471) 2548254, 2548406\nE-mail: kbc.kscste@kerala.gov.in\n"

The government of Tamil Nadu under the Department of Social Welfare and Women Empowerment announced a scheme whereby women travelers can travel without paying any fare in government-run normal-fare buses (for short distances of up to 30 kilometers) in cities and towns in the state.
