It focuses mainly on individuals engaged in unregulated sectors.\n<br>\n\nProject Implementing Agencies (PIAs) such as private and public sector expert bodies in the sector, Central and State Government ministries and their institutions and other agencies designated by MSDE/NSDC are being incentivised to implement RPL projects in any of the five models (RPL camps, RPL at employer’s premises, RPL by demand, RPL with best-in-class employers and online RPL).\n<br>\n\nRPL has 12 hours of orientation. To address knowledge gaps, PIAs offer bridge courses to candidates along with the 12-hour orientation domain skills, soft skills and entrepreneurship tips and familiarization with the assessment process.\n<br>\n\nAny revisions made to these guidelines will be uploaded on the official website of PMKVY (www. pmkvyofficial.org).

        "detailedDescription_md": "A scholarship scheme by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology with an objective to enhance the number of PhDs in Electronics System Design &amp; Manufacturing (ESDM) and IT/IT Enabled Services (IT/ITES) sectors in the country. Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the scheme in 2014 for a period of nine years with a total estimated cost of ₹ 466 crores. The duration of the scheme is five years for the purpose of selecting candidates for support under the scheme. However, the funding would be continued till the 9th year for the commitments already made during the scheme period.\n<br>\n\n> **Objectives:**\n\n\n1. To enhance the number of PhDs in Electronics System Design &amp; Manufacturing (ESDM) and IT/IT Enabled Services (IT/ITES) sectors in the country.\n1. Give thrust to R&amp;D, create an innovative ecosystem and enhance India’s competitiveness in these knowledge-intensive sectors.\n1. To fulfill the commitments made in National Policy on Electronics (NPE 2012) and National Policy on Information Technology (NPIT 2012) which recommend giving special thrust on significantly increasing the number of PhDs in the country to enable India to compete globally in the coming decades, to develop an ecosystem of research, development and IP creation in these knowledge-intensive sectors.\n1. To Support 1500 Ph.D. Candidates including both Full-Time (500) and Part-Time (1000) in each of the ESDM and IT/ITES sectors (Total: 3000 PhDs).\n1. The scheme is also expected to encourage working professionals and non-PhD faculty members to pursue Ph.D.\n\n<br>\n\n> **Salient features of the Ph.D. scheme are as follows:**\n\n\n1. This Scheme provides 25% more fellowship amount than most of the other Ph.D. Schemes.\n1. The scheme also provides an infrastructural grant of ₹ 5,00,000/- per candidate to the academic institutions for the creation/ up-gradation of laboratories.\n1. Part-time Ph.D. candidates get a one-time incentive on completion of the Ph.D.\n1. The scheme also supports 200 Young Faculty Research Fellowships in the areas of ESDM and IT/ITES with the objective to retain and attract bright young faculty members in these sectors.\n\n"
