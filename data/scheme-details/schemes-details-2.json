        "detailedDescription_md": "> **Introduction**\n\nSaansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) was launched on 11th October 2014 with the aim to translate the comprehensive vision of Mahatma Gandhi about an ideal Indian village into reality, keeping in view the present context. Under SAGY, each Member of Parliament adopts a Gram Panchayat and guides its holistic progress giving importance to social development at par with infrastructure. The &#39;Adarsh Grams&#39; are to become schools of local development and governance, inspiring other Gram Panchayats. By involving villagers and leveraging scientific tools, a village development plan is prepared under the leadership of a Member of Parliament. The distinct feature of this Yojana is that it is: Demand Driven, Inspired by Society, and Based on People&#39;s Participation.\n<br>\n\n> **Objectives**\n\nTo trigger processes that lead to the holistic development of the identified Gram Panchayats\nTo substantially improve the standard of living and quality of life of all sections of the population through -\nImproved basic amenities, Higher productivity, Enhanced human development, Better livelihood opportunity, Reduced disparities, Access to rights and entitlements, Wider social mobilization, Enriched social capital\nTo generate models of local level development and effective local government which can motivate and inspire neighboring, Gram Panchayats to learn and adapt.\nTo nurture the identified Adarsh Grams as schools of local development to train other gram panchayats\n<br>\n\n> **Values**\n\nFar beyond mere infrastructure development, SAGY aims at instilling specific values in the villages and their people so that they get transformed into models for others. These values include:\n1.  Adopting people’s participation as an end in itself – ensuring the involvement of all sections of society in all aspects related to the life of the village, especially in decision-making related to governance\n2.  Adhering to Antyodaya – enabling the “poorest and the weakest person” in the village to achieve well-being \n3.  Affirming gender equality and ensuring respect for women\n4.

It is also expected that the research work would enrich the institution with a new creative edge and academic excellence.\n&gt; **Nodal Institutions (Participating Institutions):**\n\nThe Scheme shall cover the institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC), as listed in the Guidelines, and may cover other such institutions in the future. The scheme will also cover Non-MoC institutions with cultural resources like manuscripts, artifacts, antiquities, books, publications, records, etc., and seek to take advantage of the scheme by engaging distinguished Fellows to work on its resources and also known for its rich publications. The nodal institutions (both MoC and non-MoC) are classified into four groups broadly based on their different areas of specialization, focus, and resources. The classification is as follows:\n1.\tGroup-A: Archaeology, Antiquities, Museums &amp;amp; Galleries\n2.\tGroup-B: Archives, Libraries and General Fellowship\n3.\tGroup-C: Anthropology &amp;amp; Sociology\n4.\tGroup D: Crafts, Performing/Visual/Literary Arts\n&gt; **Scope of the Scheme:**\n\nThe scope of the Scheme is to enable the identified cultural institutions to engage Fellows of outstanding merit, to work on research projects in order to unravel their unexplored resources. For purposes of convenience, monitoring, accounting, and responsibility, one of the institutions listed above would be the ‘Nodal Institution’ for each project, and the Fellows will be attached/anchored to that institution.\n&gt; **Duration of the Fellowship:**\n\n\n  - The duration of the Fellowship will be for a maximum period of two years.\n  - In exceptional cases, the institution may recommend to the NSC an extension for a period of up to one more year, or a reduction to somewhat less than two years, if it is supported by its assessment of the quality of the work undertaken. However, in the case of extension, the fellow won’t be eligible for any remuneration including contingency.\n  - The award of the Fellowship will commence from the date of joining and the ‘months’ and ‘years’ will be reckoned accordingly.\n\n&gt; **Number of Fellowships:**\n\n\n  - The scheme envisages the granting of up to 15 Fellowships in a year.\n  - Each nodal institution can be awarded 1 Fellowship in a year. However, the MoC has the discretionary power to relax these numbers.\n\n&gt; **Administration of the Scheme:**\n\nThe total number of Fellowships administered by the institutions may be decided by the Ministry of Culture from time to time, in consultation with the participating institutions. This will be based on certain criteria such as the size of its untapped holdings, physical facilities already existing in the institution, the capacity of the institution to guide and inspire the Fellows to get the best out of them, its past record in publication and research, need for research/study in a particular area, etc. An amount of up to 2% of the total allocation may be set aside for meeting expenses related to the administration of the scheme including monitoring, implementation, inspection, review, etc. of the research work carried out by the Fellows, through outsourcing or Consultants. \n",
        "benefits_md": "> **Honorarium:**\n\n\n   1. A Tagore National Fellow who is from a University, College, Research Institute, or Government setup in India would be entitled to the same pay, including grade pay, etc., which he/she would have drawn had he/she continued in his/her parent organization. Essential or mandatory contributions of the employer to Provident Fund etc. would be paid by the parent organizations as would have been paid by them had he/she continued in his/her parent organization.\n   1. A Fellow from abroad or from a set-up other than University, College, Research Institute or Government service, or who has retired from active service and/or is on pension, would be entitled to a fixed honorarium of ₹80,000/- per month.\n   1. No payment of honorarium would normally be made to a Fellow receiving full funding from other sources up to the level of the honorarium, but such Fellow will, however, receive a Contingency Grant, other allowances, and facilities, as decided by the NSC.  \n\n&gt; **Contingency Grant:**\n\n\n  - In case of foreign and Indian research fellows residing or serving abroad and having been selected as Tagore Fellows under Non-MoC institutions, to and fro economy class airfare from their country of residence will be provided/reimbursed by the Ministry once during the course of the Fellowship.\n  - Similarly, all fellows under Non-MoC institutions who take up the Fellowship under the Scheme will be reimbursed, on an ‘actual’ basis, contingent expenses for making academic trips, engaging research assistants, etc. up to a maximum ceiling of ₹2.50 lakhs per annum, during the tenure of Fellowship subject to verification of requisite bills by the Nodal Institutions.\n\n**Note:** For Fellows selected under MoC Institutions, the expenditure in this regard will be borne by the concerned MoC Institution from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry.\n&gt; **Accommodation:**\n\n\n  - A Fellow who is not a bona-fide resident of the place of the Participating Institution to which he has proposed to be affiliated and who intends to take up rented accommodation in the city of the desired Institution will be required to indicate this fact at the time of applying for Fellowship.\n  - The selected Fellow will be entitled to receive a House Rent Allowance of up to 30% of the honorarium. However, with respect to Fellows from Universities, colleges, Research institutes, or Government setups HRA will be paid by the Parent Organization as per entitlement.\n  - The MoC Institutions will bear the expenditure in this regard from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry.\n  - In respect of Non-MoC Institutions, the Ministry of Culture will reimburse the House Rent Allowance directly to Fellows on submission of rent receipts (in original) to the Participating Institutions who will verify and forward the same to the Ministry for reimbursement.\n\n&gt; **Settling Allowance:**\n\n\n  - A Fellow from outstation will be given, if required, a lump sum grant of ₹1.00 lakh as settling allowance for packing/transportation, etc., of his personal belongings from the old station to the new station of his stay during the tenure of Fellowship, if he moves station or otherwise transports books and academic effects.\n  - Allowance of an equal amount will also be given at the conclusion of the Fellowship for moving out of station. On a case-to-case basis, economy airfare from his/her place/country of residence will be provided/reimbursed upon joining and at the conclusion of the Fellowship. In this regard, Non-MoC Institutions will bear the expenditure and thereafter seek reimbursement from the Ministry after submission of certified copies of Bills along with justification.\n\n&gt; **Support to Fellows:**\n\n\n  - Infrastructural support will be provided by the Nodal Institution to the Fellows to enable them to conduct their research. This may include the provision of a computer with peripherals and connectivity, working space in the institution’s premises, providing a congenial atmosphere to carry out research, etc. Other facilities, like appropriate seating arrangements, library facilities, etc., will also be made available.\n  - One important advantage of this scheme will be the access of the Fellows to national institutions for study and avail original and rare research material. In respect of foreign fellows engaged under this scheme, necessary political/security clearances from the concerned Ministries/Departments shall be obtained by the Ministry of Culture.\n  - Encouragement and financial support may also be given to enable the Fellows to present papers at conferences hosted by the concerned institution or other related organizations and institutions, which will be met out/reimbursed, on an ‘actuals’ basis, with a ceiling of ₹1.00 lakh per annum, provided adequate academic interaction is arranged\n\n",

Fellows who have sound academic or professional credentials and have made significant contributions to knowledge in their respective fields will be eligible to apply for Tagore National Fellowship.\n   1. Preferably the Fellows who have 5 years of experience in conducting/guiding research or the same experience in performing/any other arts can apply for Tagore National Fellowship.\n   1. The applicants must have an impressive list of publications into their credit, at least two monographs (single-authored).\n   1. Fellows to be engaged must have both the credentials as laid down in the preceding paragraph, as well as a strong reputation in the field covered by the Nodal Institution.\n   1. Those who have in the past directly engaged with major projects at the Nodal Institution and fulfilled the above-mentioned eligibility criteria for a Tagore Fellow are encouraged to apply for the Tagore National Fellowship.\n   1. Once awarded a Tagore National Fellowship, a candidate cannot apply again for a Fellowship under this scheme, either at the same or any other institution covered under the Scheme.\n   1. The Scheme will be open to both Indian and foreign nationals. However, the proportion of foreigners will not normally exceed one–third of the total fellowships awarded in a year.\n\n**Note 01:** Interested Fellows are required to enclose a research proposal prepared on the guidelines provided in Appendix A.\n**Note 02:** Fellows are also required to prepare a short write-up on how the proposed research would be beneficial for the respective nodal institution.\n**Note 03:** The honour and the honorarium are both of a very high order; the Institution Level Search-cum-Screening Committee (ILSSC) of the sponsoring institution and the National Selection Committee may keep these in mind while recommending/ selecting the Tagore National Fellows.\n**Note 04:** In short, a person selected for the Tagore National Fellowship should be one who has already become a ‘legend’ in his area of work or is regarded very highly. It is appropriate that those who do not come near this description may not apply or be considered for the highest honour and honorarium accorded to a Fellow in India under this Fellowship.\n&gt; **Areas of Research and Eligible Projects:**\n\n\n   1. The selected Fellows will normally work on a project that benefits the Nodal Institution in terms of unraveling its resources. The subject of research should be one that can be usefully pursued with the resources and facilities of the Nodal Institution awarding the Fellowship, though he/she will be free to draw on the resources and facilities of other institutions, as well.\n   1. If the subject of research extends to more than one institution or the Fellow otherwise needs to draw upon the resources and facilities of other institution(s), the Nodal Institution awarding the Fellowship would recommend the Fellow to such other institution(s). In rare cases, where two institutions appear to be of almost equal importance to the Fellows, the second institution may be deemed to be the ‘Co-institution’ and the two may sign a Tripartite MoU regarding Intellectual Property, Publication, Credit sharing, facilities, etc. but accounting shall be with the Nodal Institution.\n   1. Since the Scheme is focused on unraveling the cultural resources of the Nodal Institution, the project must be driven in that direction, that is, to use substantially the resources of the Nodal Institution. The inputs required for the project should have a very strong linkage with the resources available with the Nodal Institution and (in rare cases) the Co-institution.\n   1. At the end of it, the project outcome must be beneficial for the Nodal Institution or co-institution, if any, and must add to the existing knowledge of the institution/subject. \n\n",

As a common facility embedded in the institution, the IDEA Lab will make engineering graduates more imaginative and creative, besides getting basic training in the 21st century skills like- critical thinking, problem solving, design thinking, collaboration, communication, lifelong learning etc. IDEA Lab can facilitate the students and faculty to “engage, explore, experience, express and excel” as desired by the Hon&amp;#39;ble Prime Minister in the wake of release of National Educational Policy 2020,\n&gt; **Purpose:**\n\n\n  - The purpose of IDEA Lab is to provide all facilities under one roof, for conversion of an idea into a prototype. With these facilities in the campus, more students and faculty will be encouraged to take up creative work and in the process, get training on creative thinking, problem solving, collaboration etc. which conventional labs are not able to. \n\n\n  - The focus will be on training students so that they become imaginative and creative and stay so at the workplaces they join. The whole idea is to transform engineering education with such a Lab in all colleges and for this they must proactively expose all students to the IDEA Lab, organize training sessions for interested students as well as support projects and by providing online learning materials. \n\n&gt; **Proposal:**\n\n\n  - As the IDEA Lab is going to be a long-term intervention aiming to transform education imparted in the institution, the proposal must spell out a clear vision for the Lab, plan of implementation, mobilization of resources, strength and enthusiasm of faculty, utilization and expansion of facilities, etc.\n  - The alignment of activities with larger national goals/ missions/ initiatives or industrial requirements or serving disadvantaged sections of society etc. and commitment of resources for the same, will impart an edge for any proposal.\n  - Shortlisted proposals will be subjected to scrutiny by a panel of experts before sanctioning of the project by AICTE.\n\n&gt;   **Implementation:**\n\nThe college/ educational campus/ university and industry are expected to participate financially, to match the contribution sought from AICTE or even exceed it, in establishing the IDEA Lab which ideally requires:\n\n  - An area of 5000 sq. ft.\n  - Should ideally remain open 24x7.\n  - To be equipped with facilities, tools and consumables to support translation of an idea to prototype development or develop solution of a problem.\n  - To hold workshops/ trainings, ideation sessions, boot-camps, competitions etc. and participate in similar activities organized by other IDEA Labs/ organizers and also in national/ international events so as to ensure that IDEA Lab is used productively and also extensively.\n  - To maintain the IDEA Lab, keep it well-furnished, take care of security, provide a safe working environment and stock adequate supplies of consumables.\n  - To provide necessary staff and all support facilities and amenities required to operate and maintain the Lab.\n  - To follow the guidelines issued by AICTE in the matter of IDEA Lab and other Government of India rules besides following the enunciated Code of Conduct (as in Annexures) in letter and spirit.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n",
