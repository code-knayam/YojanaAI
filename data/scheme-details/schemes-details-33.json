The insurance coverage is ordinarily effective only after receipt of the entire amount of premium i.e. both the Government’s as well as beneficiary’s share. \n   1. In an unlikely situation where the Government’s share of the premium is not ready, the LIC shall accept the share of the beneficiary and affect the coverage accordingly.\n   1. The office of the State Director-in-charge of Handlooms &amp;amp; Textiles and its subordinate offices in the field shall be the Nodal agencies for implementation of the scheme. \n   1.
