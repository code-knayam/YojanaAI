The Government has implemented a comprehensive strategy to address the sanitation challenges prevalent in rural areas. The primary focus of this strategy is to encourage and motivate rural communities to abandon the traditional practice of open defecation and adopt safe sanitation practices. The Maharishi Valmiki Sampoorn Swachata Puruskar (MVSSP) has been introduced as part of this initiative. The MVSSP is an annual competition that aims to identify and recognize the cleanest Gram Panchayat at various levels, including block, district, division, and state. The competition serves as a platform to evaluate the cleanliness and hygiene conditions maintained by Gram Panchayats. Factors such as waste management, sanitation infrastructure, and active community participation are taken into consideration during the evaluation process. The winners of the MVSSP at the state and divisional levels are honored by the Honorable Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh during the Independence Day celebrations each year. Similarly, the district and block-level winners receive prizes from senior dignitaries. This recognition incentivizes Gram Panchayats to maintain high cleanliness standards and continue their efforts towards improved sanitation.\n",
        "benefits_md": "\n   1. **Block Level:** The Gram Panchayat that attains the first position at the block level receives a cash prize of 1 lakh rupees. This monetary reward serves as recognition for their exemplary efforts in maintaining cleanliness and sanitation within their community.   1. **District Level:** The prize amount increases to 3 lakh rupees at the district level. Two Gram Panchayats can receive the prize if a district has more than 300 Gram Panchayats. This encourages healthy competition among Gram Panchayats within the district, fostering a cleaner and more hygienic environment.   1. **Division Level:** The winning Gram Panchayat at the division level is awarded a cash prize of 5 lakh rupees. This higher prize amount recognizes the exceptional cleanliness standards achieved by the Gram Panchayat within their division.   1. **State Level:** The highest recognition and incentives are reserved for the winning Gram Panchayat at the state level. The state-level winner receives a generous cash prize of 10 lakh rupees. This substantial reward serves as a testament to their outstanding commitment to cleanliness and sanitation practices.\n",
        "exclusions_md": "\n   1. **Non-Open Defecation-Free Gram Panchayats:** Gram Panchayats that have not achieved the status of being open defecation-free are not eligible to participate in the MVSSP competition. This requirement ensures that participating Gram Panchayats have successfully eradicated the practice of open defecation within their communities.   1. **Previous Level Winners:** Winning Gram Panchayats at any level are excluded from participating in the MVSSP competition for the same level for the next three years. For example, if a Gram Panchayat wins the Block level award in a specific year, they are not eligible to compete for the Block level award for the following three years. However, they can participate in the competition at a higher level. For instance, they can compete for the District, Division, or State level awards in the subsequent years.   1. **State-Level Winner:** The Gram Panchayat that wins the state-level award is not eligible to participate in the MVSSP competition for three years after the year of winning. This exclusion allows other Gram Panchayats to have an opportunity to showcase their cleanliness achievements and compete for the prestigious state-level award.\n",

The Government has implemented a comprehensive strategy to address the sanitation challenges prevalent in rural areas. The primary focus of this strategy is to encourage and motivate rural communities to abandon the traditional practice of open defecation and adopt safe sanitation practices. The Maharishi Valmiki Sampoorn Swachata Puruskar (MVSSP) has been introduced as part of this initiative. The MVSSP is an annual competition that aims to identify and recognize the cleanest Gram Panchayat at various levels, including block, district, division, and state. The competition serves as a platform to evaluate the cleanliness and hygiene conditions maintained by Gram Panchayats. Factors such as waste management, sanitation infrastructure, and active community participation are taken into consideration during the evaluation process. The winners of the MVSSP at the state and divisional levels are honored by the Honorable Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh during the Independence Day celebrations each year. Similarly, the district and block-level winners receive prizes from senior dignitaries. This recognition incentivizes Gram Panchayats to maintain high cleanliness standards and continue their efforts towards improved sanitation."
