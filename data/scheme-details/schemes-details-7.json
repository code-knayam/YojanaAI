Initially, 25 lakhs beneficiaries were given the card under the State assisted scheme of Provident Fund for Unorganized Workers (SASPFUW). Finally, the cards have been distributed to disburse benefits under three schemes of State government namely: i) State assisted scheme of Provident Fund for Unorganized Workers (SASPFUW) ii) Buildings and other Construction workers&#39; welfare scheme iii) Motor Transport workers&#39; welfare scheme. The objective of the project is to realize the following objectives: \ni) Bringing the maximum number of Workers under the welfare schemes \nii) Smooth and Speedy delivery of Welfare benefits under the three schemes \niii) Effective and Transparent management and utilization of the funds available.\n<br>\n\n&#39;SAMAJIK MUKTI CARD’ for the marginal &amp; unorganized sector workers in the State is an important step towards the empowerment of all unorganised sector workers.\n<br>\n\nThe vision is to enroll all unorganized sector workers under State Assisted Scheme of Provident Fund for Unorganized Workers (SASPFUW), Buildings and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare (BOCWA) and West Bengal Motor Transport Workers’ Welfare (WBTWSS) Schemes and the unorganized sector workers covered under SASPFUW are getting special smart cards called ‘SAMAJIK MUKTI CARD’ Smart Card (with 32 KB memory) based solution for Samajik Mukti Card brings immense benefits:\n\n1. An online web based application in connection with administration of SASPFUW Scheme is already in operation and would become fully functional in the near future. A beneficiary would be able to have an access to his/ her records through this “Samajik Mukti Card”.\n1. “Samajik Mukti Card” can be used by an unorganized worker at any of the 68 Regional labour Offices (R.L.O) at districts and subdivisions as well as in all 480 Labour Welfare Facilitation Centres (L.W.F.C) in blocks and Municipalities. All such offices are provided with computer along with card reader and card writer. On inserting the card in the card reader/ writer, the required information will be seen on computer screen. Once transaction is made and /or benefits are availed by a worker, it will be automatically updated and shown in the computer screen. The card reader/ writer system will be connected to the Central SASPFUW Server hosted at SDC.\n1. “Samajik Mukti Card” is a photo identity smart card for unorganized workers. The card could be read from any R.L.O or L.W.F.C. The records of transaction made and/or benefits availed are electronically maintained and data is tamper proof and highly secured.\n1. It is also an attempt to integrate all social security benefits available for the unorganized workers.\n\n<br>\n\nThe objective of the project is to realize following objectives: \ni) Bringing maximum number of Workers under the welfare schemes \nii) Smooth and Speedy delivery of Welfare benefits under the three schemes \niii) Effective and Transparent management and utilization of the funds available.\n<br>\n\nThe benefits of this scheme include the following:\n\n- Provident Fund is given to the unorganised worker to provide financial security and stability.\n- Compensation in case of death or disability during work.\n- The government provides financial assistance to the children of beneficiaries who pursue higher studies (for the applicants registered for at least one year). Besides, they give training in safety and skill development.\n- The department also provides health treatment facilities to the unorganised workers who have registered under this scheme.\n\n<br>\n\nEligibility: \nThe unorganized workers who want to become members should be residing in West Bengal between the age of 18 to 60 and the family income should not exceed 65 thousand rupees per month.

Apart from the document for certifying the above, no more documents are to be produced for enrolling with the Samarth Centre. Also, the PwD is automatically included in the BPL category. The PwD is enrolled for Niramaya along with registration for Samarth.\n\n&gt; **Step-4:** In all other cases, a check is made on whether the PwD is applicable for the LIG or BPL funding by the National Trust\n\n&gt; **Step-5:** The parent or guardian is required to fill the Enrolment Form along with the originals and photocopies of the below mentioned documents. The documents and records for each PwD are to be maintained in separate files.\n\n&gt; **Step-6:** In case of successful verification of all the above furnished documents, the PwD is enrolled at the Samarth centre – a confirmation Enrolment ID card/receipt is handed over to the PwDs parents or guardians ( if any) along with a starter kit. Further details about the starting date, rules and regulations etc. are to be mentioned by the Samarth representatives.\n\n&gt; **Step-7:** Parents and guardians of the PwDs are given a detailed insight on the Niramaya health insurance scheme by the Samarth representatives, in case the PwD has not availed it already. A RO representative may assist with the registration of the PwD under the Niramaya scheme, in case the parents or guardian agree for the same.

        "detailedDescription_md": "The Scheme “Tagore National Scholarship for Cultural Research” has been introduced to invigorate and revitalize the various institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC) and other identified cultural institutions in the country, by encouraging scholars/academicians to affiliate themselves with these institutions to work on projects of mutual interest.\n    With a view to infusing fresh knowledge capital into the institutions, the scheme expects these scholars/academicians to select specific resources of the institutions to use in their projects and take up research works that are related to the main objectives of these institutions. It is also expected that the research work would enrich the institution with a new creative edge and academic excellence.\n&gt; **Nodal Institutions (Participating Institutions):**\n\nThe Scheme shall cover the institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC), as listed in the [Guidelines](https://www.indiaculture.gov.in/sites/default/files/Schemes/TNFCR%20Guidelines_14-07-2023_17072023.pdf), and may cover other such institutions in the future. The scheme will also cover Non-MoC institutions with cultural resources like manuscripts, artifacts, antiquities, books, publications, records, etc., and seek to take advantage of the scheme by engaging distinguished Scholars to work on its resources and also known for its rich publications. The nodal institutions (both MoC and non-MoC) are classified into four groups broadly based on their different areas of specialization, focus, and resources. The classification is as follows:\n1.\tGroup-A: Archaeology, Antiquities, Museums &amp;amp; Galleries\n2.\tGroup-B: Archives, Libraries and General Scholarship\n3.\tGroup-C: Anthropology &amp;amp; Sociology\n4.\tGroup D: Crafts, Performing/Visual/Literary Arts\n&gt; **Scope of the Scheme:**\n\nThe scope of the Scheme is to enable the identified cultural institutions to engage Scholars of outstanding merit, to work on research projects in order to unravel their unexplored resources. For purposes of convenience, monitoring, accounting, and responsibility, one of the institutions listed above would be the ‘Nodal Institution’ for each project, and the Scholars will be attached/anchored to that institution.\n&gt; **Duration of the Scholarship:**\n\n\n  - The duration of the Tagore Scholarship is up to 2 years.\n  - In exceptional cases, the institution may recommend to the NSC an extension for a period of up to one more year, or a reduction to somewhat less than two years, if it is supported by its assessment of the quality of the work undertaken. However, in the case of extension, the Scholar won’t be eligible for any remuneration including contingency.\n\n\n  - The award of the Scholarship will commence from the date of joining and the ‘months’ and ‘years’ will be reckoned accordingly.\n\n&gt; **Number of Scholarships:**\n\n\n  - The scheme envisages the granting of up to 25 Scholarships in a year.\n  - Each nodal institution can be awarded 1 Scholarship or a maximum of 2 scholarships in a year. However, the MoC has the discretionary power to relax these numbers.\n\n&gt; **Administration of the Scheme:**\n\nThe total number of Scholarships administered by the institutions may be decided by the Ministry of Culture from time to time, in consultation with the participating institutions.

This scheme also gives opportunities to young artists/performers to apply for the scholarship.\n   1.

The selected Scholars will normally work on a project that benefits the Nodal Institution in terms of unraveling its resources.

If the subject of research extends to more than one institution or the Scholar otherwise needs to draw upon the resources and facilities of other institution(s), the Nodal Institution awarding the Scholarship would recommend the Scholars to such other institution(s).

Since the Scheme is focused on unraveling the cultural resources of the Nodal Institution, the project must be driven in that direction, that is, to use substantially the resources of the Nodal Institution. The inputs required for the project should have a very strong linkage with the resources available with the Nodal Institution and (in rare cases) the Co-institution.\n   1. At the end of it, the project outcome must be beneficial for the Nodal Institution or co-institution, if any, and must add to the existing knowledge of the institution/subject.\n\n",

The present practice of crop protection by manual guarding did not ensure 100 percent crop protection. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme “Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana” in the name of Solar Fencing. Under this scheme, a subsidy of 85% is being provided if three or more farmers opt to install solar fencing, and if farmers opt to install solar fencing on individual land then an 80% subsidy is being provided. The fence is energized with the help of solar power. Current fences around the farms will be sufficient to keep away stray animals, wild animals, and monkeys from the farms.\n**2.\tAnti-Hail Net Structure:** Hailstorms in Himachal Pradesh are one of the major natural calamities resulting in substantial economic loss to the farmers by damaging standing vegetable crops both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. In order to mitigate the losses caused by hail storms the new scheme “Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana (Anti-Hail Net Structure)” was started by the State Government in 2020-21 and implemented through the Department of Agriculture. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme “Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojna” in the name of Anti Hail Nets. The schemes will primarily benefit farmers helping them to substantially, reduce the quantitative and qualitative losses to their vegetable produce. Financial assistance maximum of up to 80% is being provided to the eligible farmer for an area coverage maximum of up to 5000 sqm. The monetary gains are expected to be approximately 15-20 crores annually with significant contributions to the state GDP.\n**3.\tGreen House Renovation Scheme:** Farmers of the state have demanded that there should be a scheme to replace the Poly sheets. Therefore, the Government of Himachal Pradesh introduced a scheme “Mukhya Mantri Green House Renovation Scheme” in the year 2017-18. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme “Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana” as a component namely Green House Renovation. Under this scheme, 70% assistance is being provided to the farmers for the replacement of poly sheets after 5 years of setting up of polyhouse or damage due to natural calamities.\n",
