So the construction worker is permanently financially unable to support the family. In such a situation, the use of three-wheelers is intended to help the construction workers as a source of income so that they can find other employment and support their families.\n",

The assistance will also be available for the amount of Registration Fee and Road Tax paid for the first time of the new Three-Wheeler. (RTO Tax and Road Tax would be reimbursed as well.)\n\n**Note 01:** The cost of the motor vehicle tax amount of the new three-wheeler, fixed by the State Government and at the prevailing rate applicable to persons with disabilities, will be borne by the registered disabled construction worker here.\n**Note 02:** This additional subsidy will be provided in addition to the subsidy available under the electric vehicle-related schemes of Government.\n",
