Selection of 30 to 50 farmers in each group, by whom the area sown of that crop would be generally 50 to 100 hectares.1. **Selection of seed producer members in the group:**- As per requirement, 2-4 seed-producing farmers are selected from the farmer group by the group itself. The rest of the group will be those farmers who will use the above-produced seeds for sowing in the coming year.1. **Free seed distribution**:- Provision to make available the desired base/certified seeds (Stage-I) free of cost to the seed-producing farmers of each farmer group.1. **Training and Rogging for seed production:**- There is a provision to spend Rs.30/- per farmer and a maximum of Rs.1500/- per training on one-day training of a group. Three one-day training programs are organized to give complete information about the seed production process to the farmers of the group. Payment to be made to farmers for Rogging (Rs.1000/- /Hect.)

Translation research has gained considerable focus as it has the potential to elevate results from fundamental research to a given technology readiness level, in turn catalyzing symbiotic growth of institutional infrastructure to offer a platform for scale-up of entrepreneurial ventures, supported by a variety of funding mechanisms. SERB-TETRA will challenge scientists executing SERB grants, such as CRG, to establish an effective, functional, and synergistic working collaboration with an industry partner to elevate their breakthrough results and technologies to TRL level 5 and beyond. It is implicit that PIs would have obtained the necessary patents and IPRs.\n         TETRA Support will help entities have successful ideas to kick-start new venture processes. With seed capital, flexible working spaces, and interaction between mentor and start-up entrepreneurs, the SERB-TETRA will expand the scope by providing numerous networking opportunities, followed by presenting the finished prototype to an audience of large investors, established MSMEs and private companies, and public sector enterprises.\n        SERB-TETRA would be awarded to select PIs who have clearly demonstrated the translational potential of their research (patents, etc.) and have established contact with industrial partners for fast-track graduation to a prototype stage and beyond. PIs would have also identified technology incubators in their own institution or in the vicinity who could support their endeavors. It is envisaged that a well-defined strategy to augment research innovation, via technology incubators, will add value to the CRG and other funding mechanisms supported by SERB.\n&gt; **Objective:**\n\nSERB-TETRA aims to provide awards to competitively funded Core Research Grants (CRG) and similar projects, holding potential and promise for translation at TRL 5 or beyond. \n&gt; **Scientific Social Responsibility:**\n\nSERB has adopted the Scientific Social Responsibility (SSR) Policy to imbibe a culture of social commitment among SERB Grantees. The policy intends to effectively utilize the scientific infrastructure and expertise of SERB grantees to benefit other S&amp;amp;T stakeholders, especially the less-endowed researchers and society. SSR activities need to be chosen after approval and depending on the activities chosen additional budget would be provided under a separate head to carry out the chosen activities. SERB Grantees need to undertake the proposed SSR activities during their project period.\n&gt; **Duration of Support:**\n\n•\tThe funding will be provided normally for a period of two years.\n",

Major interventions under NHM include, supply of quality planting material through establishment of nurseries and tissue culture units, production and productivity improvement programmes through area expansion and rejuvenation, technology promotion, technology dissemination, human resource development, creation of infrastructure for post harvest management and marketing in consonance with the comparative advantages of each State/region and their diverse agro-climatic conditions.\n<br>\n\nHorticulture Mission for North East and Himalayan States (HMNEH) aims to achieve overall development of Horticulture in NE and Himalayan states. The mission covers all NE States including Sikkim and three Himalayan states of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.\n<br>\n\nExecutive Committee of MIDH decides the annual outlay to various implementing agencies (SHMs and NLAs). Accordingly, implementing agencies submit an Annual Action Plan (AAP) for the approval supported with data/write up on outcome of past interventions and also covering the details of various interventions proposed to be taken up during the current financial year. While finalizing the AAPs, due attention is paid for earmarking specific targets for Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and women beneficiaries. As an inbuilt provision under MIDH scheme, higher rates of subsidy have been envisaged for taking up activities like creation of infrastructure for post-harvest management and marketing of horticulture produce along with area expansion by beneficiaries in the North Eastern States, Himalayan States, Tribal Sub Plan areas, Andaman &amp; Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands.\nThe key objectives of the Mission are as follows:\n•\tPromote holistic growth of horticulture sector, including bamboo and coconut through area based regionally differentiated strategies, which includes research, technology promotion, extension, post-harvest management, processing and marketing, in consonance with comparative advantage of each State/region and its diverse agro-climatic features\n•\tEncourage aggregation of farmers into farmer groups like FIGs/FPOs and FPCs to bring economy of scale and scope.\n•\tEnhance horticulture production, augment farmers, income and strengthen nutritional security;\n•\tImprove productivity by way of quality germplasm, planting material and water use efficiency through Micro Irrigation.\n•\tSupport skill development and create employment generation opportunities for rural youth in horticulture and post-harvest management, especially in the cold chain sector.\nUnder MIDH, financial assistance is provided for following major interventions/activities:\n•\tSetting up of nurseries, tissue culture units for production of quality seed and planting material.\n•\tArea expansion i.e. Establishment of new orchards and gardens for fruits, vegetables, and flowers.\n•\tRejuvenation of unproductive, old, and senile orchards.\n•\tProtected cultivation, i.e. poly-house, green-house, etc, to improve the productivity &amp; grow off season high value vegetables and flowers.\n•\tOrganic farming and certification.\n•\tCreation of water resources structures and watershed management.\n•\tBeekeeping for pollination.\n•\tHorticulture Mechanization.\n•\tCreation of Post-Harvest Management and Marketing infrastructure.\n",

The scheme&#39;s benefits are therefore paid directly to bank accounts in the girls&#39; names, leaving the decision of utilizing the money in their hands.\n<br>\n\nTo reinforce the positive impact of increased education and delayed marriages, the scheme also works to enhance the social power and self-esteem of girls through a targeted behavior change communication strategy. The communication strategy not only builds awareness of the scheme, but includes adolescent-friendly approaches like events, competitions, and Kanyashree clubs, and the endorsement of strong women figures as role models to promote social and psychological empowerment.\n<br>\n\nAs more and more girls remain in school, it is envisaged that they will use the opportunity to gain skills and knowledge to help them become economically independent. Even if girls do get married soon after they turn 18, it is expected that their education and enhanced social and emotional development will give them a better foundation for their adult lives. And over time, as entire generations of women enter marriages only after they have some degree of economic independence, it is expected that the practice of child marriage will be completely eradicated. Women will attain their right to health, education, and socio-economic equality.\n<br>\n\n**The main objective of the scheme is to prevent child marriage and promote education among girls. It also aims to improve the health and nutrition of girls and empower them by building their skills and capacities.**\n<br>\n\nThe scheme is implemented through a network of school teachers, community workers, and government officials. The scheme has been recognized as a best practice in girl-child empowerment by the United Nations.\n<br>\n\nOverall, the Kanyashree Prakalpa scheme has been successful in promoting the education and well-being of girls in West Bengal and has been replicated in other parts of the country.\n"

The fellowship is provided normally for a period of 2 years. The scheme is open to unemployed women who are permanent residents of Kerala and qualified with PhD in Science or Engineering. The objective of the scheme is to support women having career breaks, facilitating their re-entry in scientific research by providing a Post-Doctoral Fellowship.\n        Back-To-Lab Post-Doctoral Fellowship Programme is aimed to support women in Science in Kerala. The programme focuses on addressing the issue of the under-representation of women in higher academics and professions particularly in Science. The programme will facilitate the re-entry of women in Science after a career break necessitated due to family commitments. Active participation of more number of women in Science is socially relevant and significant, especially in a developing economy. Further, the programme would benefit qualitative interventions in Science research by effective utilization of human resource potential.\n**Necessary conditions as per the scheme:**\n\n  - There should be a Scientist Mentor who is a regular faculty/staff of the institution under whose guidance the researcher should carry out the work. The Scientist Mentor should have at least 5 or more years of service left in the Institution before retirement. The Scientist Mentor should constantly monitor the progress of the project, facilitate smooth implementation of the programme and ensure timely submission of financial utilization certificates by the institute to KSCSTE.\n  - Post-Doctoral Fellow availing financial assistance/stipend from other State/Central funding agencies or other sources will not be simultaneously eligible for KSCSTE Back-to-Lab Post-Doctoral Fellowship. The Post-Doctoral Fellow should furnish an undertaking to the effect that she is not availing financial assistance/stipend from any other source simultaneously.\n  - The implementing Institute should provide full infrastructural facilities such as a laboratory, computer, library, communication, accommodation, water, electricity, etc. for smooth implementation of the project.\n  - The unutilized portion of the grant (along with the interest accrued) at the end of the project period should be refunded to Council by DD in favour of Member Secretary, KSCSTE.\n  - Scientists who publish technical/ scientific papers based on the research work done under the project should acknowledge the assistance received from KSCSTE.\n  - The Post-Doctoral Fellow should not enter into collaboration with a foreign party (individual/ industry) without prior approval of the Council.\n\n",

Normal interventions by the Government in this regard would not be adequate to address the problem. Under CMSGUY there is a proposal to initiate massive investments in rural areas for complete rural empowerment in a period of five years in a focused and concerted manner to realize the dream of doubling the farm income.\n<br>\n\nThis is sought to be achieved through a &#39;saturation model&#39; by covering each revenue village through focused interventions in \n\n1. Direct economic activities, \n1. Logistic support including market linkages, and \n1. Community support.\n\n<br>\n\nAbove focused interventions are aimed at in nine critical areas and related sub-missions are:\n\n1. Fishery Mission,\n1. Milk Mission,\n1. Organic Mission,\n1. Land Management and Conservation Mission,\n1. Sericulture, Khadi and Cottage Industry Mission,\n1. Road and Broadband connectivity,\n1. Semi-Processing, Processing and Market Linkages,\n1. &quot;Youth-Yoga-Sports&quot; Mission and\n1. e-Gram Mission by developing Village Knowledge Centres by strengthening traditional Namghar and other community institutions\n\n"
