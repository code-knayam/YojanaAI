The Expert Committee will give justification on case to case basis for its recommendations.\n\n&gt; 2.\tThe scrutiny of applications by the Expert Committee will be done periodically subject to the availability of funds and applications for the grant.\n\n&gt; 3.\tInitially the scheme for new organizations may be for one Guru and two Artists which may be gradually increased up to one Guru and eighteen Artists. However, the increase should not be more than 100% of the existing strength at any point of time and for dance and music, it should not exceed one Guru and ten Artists.\n\n&gt; 4.\tKeeping in view the budgetary constraints and in order to give opportunity to new Artists group/organizations, 10% of the existing organizations getting financial assistance under the scheme may be phased out every year. Criteria of phasing out may be past performance, reputation, art of working (rare/ traditional / experimental /innovative/original/endangered art form etc.).\n\n&gt; 5.\tThere will be personal interaction for renewal of scheme proposals.\n\n"
