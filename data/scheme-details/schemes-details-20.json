The Scheme was initiated with a view to facilitate continuation of education by students belonging to OBCs, especially those hailing from rural and remote areas and from poor families.\n**Objective:**\nThe scheme aims at providing hostel facilities to students belonging to socially and educationally backward classes, especially from rural areas, to enable them to pursue secondary and higher education. Priority will be given for the proposals for construction of hostels for under-graduate students vis-a-vis below under-graduate level.\n",
        "benefits_md": "***1. The cost per hostel seat in different areas under the scheme are as follows:-***\n\n- North Eastern Region: ₹3.50 lakh per seat\n- Himalayan Regions: ₹3.25 lakh per seat\n- Rest of country: ₹3.00 lakh per seat\n\n**(OR)** as per the schedule of the rates for the concerned State Government, whichever is lower.\n**2.** There will also be a one-time non-recurring grant of ₹2,500/- per seat for providing furniture/equipment to the hostels constructed under the Scheme.\n**3. The funding pattern as per the guidelines are:**\n\n  - The cost of construction of hostels for Boys has to be shared between the Centre and the State in 60:40 ratio.\n  - There will be 90% central assistance to State Governments in case of Girls Hostels and 10% of cost will be borne by the State Governments.\n  - In case of Union Territories, the Central Assistance shall be 100% and for North Eastern States and 3 Himalayan States (Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand), it shall be 90%.\n  - For Central Universities/Institutes, the share will be 90% by Government of India and 10% by the Central University/Institute for both Boys and Girls Hostels.\n  - The amount of grant will be released in 3 installments in 50:45:5 ratio, of which 5% grant will be released after completion of the work and occupation of the rooms by the OBC Boys and Girls.\n\n**Note:** The construction work of the Hostel has to be completed within eighteen months from award of work order or two years from the release of 1st installment of Central assistance, whichever is earlier. In no case the time will be extended beyond 2 years. Any cost escalation due to delay in the project will be borne by the State/Institute. Proposals for 2nd installment must be received in this Ministry within one year from the date of release of 1st installment after completing construction work up to roof level.\n",
