The Scheme is meant for improving the financial and socio-economic status of the old artists and scholars who have contributed significantly in their specialized fields of arts, letters, etc. in their active age or are still contributing in the field of arts, letters, etc. but due to old age, they have to lead a miserable life or are in penury condition.\nUnder the scheme, financial assistance from the Government may be given in the form of a monthly allowance. Such allowance given to the artists recommended under the center-state Quota will be shared by the Centre and State Government/UT Administration concerned.\n**The following two types of cases/requests will be covered under the Scheme:**\n\n   1. Existing beneficiaries getting monthly artistes pension under the 1961 Scheme of ‘Financial Assistance to Persons Distinguished in Letters, Arts and such other walks of life who may be in indigent circumstances’ as amended from time to time; and\n   1. Fresh cases of artists, writers, etc. who are eligible for a grant/monthly financial assistance under the extant guidelines of the Scheme.\n\n**Administration of the Scheme:**\nThe Scheme will be implemented by the Ministry with the support of all Zonal Cultural Centres and SCZCC, Nagpur will be the main coordinator. The Ministry reserves the right to modify the provisions of the Scheme at any time. In order to implement the Scheme in a better perspective, the Scheme Guidelines will be circulated widely through State Governments/UT Administrations along with sharing the data of beneficiaries of the Central Government with them.\n",

In case of the death of a beneficiary getting an artist pension, the financial assistance may be transferred, at the discretion of the Central Government, in the name of the spouse of the beneficiary till life.\n\n**Note 01:** The monthly allowance contributed by the State Government/UT Administration concerned shall be at least ₹500/- per month per beneficiary.\n**Note 02:** The monthly allowance contributed by the Central Government shall not exceed ₹5500/- per month per beneficiary.\n**Note 03:** Out of ₹6000/-, the monthly contribution of allowance of the Central Government will be less than the extent of the monthly contribution of allowance being provided to the applicant by the State Government/UT Administration.\n**Note 04:** If State Government is already providing ₹1000/- per month pension to an artiste recommended to get financial assistance from the Central Government under this Scheme, in that case, the contribution of the Central Government would be only ₹5000/- per month.\n**Note 05:** In respect of State Govt./UT Administration where there is no provision for an Artist&amp;#39;s Pension, ₹6000/- per month will be paid as an Artist Pension by the Central Government.\n**Note 06:** In case of the death of a beneficiary, a request application should be received in the Ministry of Culture from the spouse along with the relevant documents within the period of one year from the date of death of the beneficiary artist.

These farmers form groups or cooperatives to pool their resources and negotiate better prices for their goats and sheep.\n<br>\n\nGroup supply is often used for the purpose of reducing costs, improving access to markets, and promoting efficient utilization of resources. The species of goats and sheep commonly found in Maharashtra include Jamunapari, Beetal, and Sirohi, among others. Group supply of goats and sheep is an important aspect of the livestock industry in Maharashtra, contributing to both the economy and food security of the region.\n<br>\n\nThe group supply system has several advantages for small-scale farmers, including reduced transportation costs, improved market access, and increased bargaining power. By working together, farmers can also share knowledge and resources, such as veterinary services and animal feed.\n<br>\n\nOverall, group supply of goat and sheep is an important component of the agricultural economy in Maharashtra, supporting small-scale farmers and providing a valuable source of meat to consumers.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n"

Since more and more poultry farmers have shown an inclination towards adopting poultry as per occupation consequent to their success in backyard schemes, they want the department to focus on commercial broiler farming in the state as well. For the benefit of such entrepreneurs/farmers and seeing the benefits of poultry rearing as an enterprise, such farmers need to be incentivized by way of assistance through Government by Broiler scheme on a subsidy basis in the state.\n**The following aims and objectives will also be achieved:-**\n\n  - To provide a good diet to the people of the state. It will be possible to make poultry available at reasonable rates if it is produced locally.

Further, it is also felt that it would be economical for the aspirants to undergo coaching in the state itself rather than going to Delhi for the same.\n  - A one-time amount is given directly to the Students.\n  - The Scheme will be implemented through the reputed coaching institutes/centers being run by the registered societies/ NGOs.\n\n**Terms of Payment to the Coaching Institutes:**\n\n  - 50% of the total cost-fee must be released by the State Govt. within one month from the date of empanelment after the bill has been raised by the Institute.\n  - The remaining 50% will be paid after completion of the course in all respects.\n  - In case of any drop-out, the State Govt. in consultation with the Institute shall take immediate steps to allow the waitlisted candidates to join the course for the remaining period, or the State Govt. shall deduct the equivalent fees from the total bills.\n\n"

Enhancement of the accessibility to suitable financial services will further ensure agricultural productivity and increase income among farmers , particularly the small and marginal land holders.\n<br>\n\nAmounting to over 10,000 crore the scheme has been tailored to relieve the debt ridden farmers from the debt trap, keeping a pragmatic vision to directly attack poverty by providing financial assistance to the vulnerable agriculture households, landless labourers as well as marginal cultivators of the state. Proposed by the Government of Odisha , KALIA scheme brings under its umbrella 92% of cultivators of the state and almost all needy landless cultivators , who can avail the benefits of this scheme through Direct Benefit Transfer Mode.\n<br>\n\n"

DAY-NRLM adopts a demand-driven approach, enabling the States to formulate their own State-specific poverty reduction action plans. The blocks and districts in which all the components of DAY-NRLM would be implemented, either through the SRLMs or partner institutions or NGOs, would be the intensive blocks and districts, whereas the remaining would be non-intensive blocks and districts. National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) is a restructured version of restructuring Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY). NRLM was renamed as DAY-NRLM (Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission) w.e.f. March 29, 2016. \n<br>\n\nNRLM has set out with an agenda to cover 7 Crore rural poor households, across 600 districts, 6000 blocks, 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats and 6 lakh villages in the country through self-managed Self Help Groups (SHGs) and federated institutions and support them for livelihoods collectives in a period of 8-10 years. In addition, the poor would be facilitated to achieve increased access to their rights, entitlements, and public services, diversified risk, and better social indicators of empowerment. NRLM believes in harnessing the innate capabilities of the poor and complements them with capacities (information, knowledge, skills, tools, finance, and collectivization) to participate in the growing economy of the country.\n<br>\n\n> **The Mission**\n\n&quot;To reduce poverty by enabling the poor households to access gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities, resulting in appreciable improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis, through building strong grassroots institutions of the poor.&quot;\n<br>\n\n> **The Core Values**\n\nInclusion of the poorest, and meaningful role to the poorest in all the processes\nTransparency and accountability of all processes and institutions\nOwnership and the key role of the poor and their institutions in all stages – planning, implementation, and, monitoring\nCommunity self-reliance and self-dependence\n<br>\n\nNRLM implementation is in a Mission Mode. This enables - \n(a) the shift from the present allocation-based strategy to a demand-driven strategy enabling the states to formulate their own livelihoods-based poverty reduction action plans, \n(b) focus on targets, outcomes, and time-bound delivery, \n(c) continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with livelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organized sector, and \n(d) monitoring against targets of poverty outcomes. \n<br>\n\nAs NRLM follows a demand-driven strategy, the States have the flexibility to develop their livelihoods-based perspective plans and annual action plans for poverty reduction. The overall plans would be within the allocation for the state based on inter-se poverty ratios.\n"

The objective of the scheme is to provide social security by way of financial assistance to widows in the age group of 18-40 years as this group is not getting benefits under the Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme. In Manipur, there are many widows of this age group due to the armed conflict and HIV/AIDS. Therefore, this scheme is indispensable for such widows to prevent difficulties and hardships to bear the daily need for survival. Widows who are domiciled in Manipur and have been residing in Manipur for more than 5 years continuously preceding the date of application are eligible under the scheme. This is a State Sponsored Scheme and only the citizens who are domiciled in the State of Manipur can apply for this scheme. The application should be submitted through the respective District Social Welfare Officer."

The objective of the scheme is to provide social security by way of financial assistance to widows in the age group of 18-40 years as this group is not getting benefits under the Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme. In Manipur, there are many widows of this age group due to the armed conflict and HIV/AIDS. Therefore, this scheme is indispensable for such widows to prevent difficulties and hardships to bear the daily need for survival. Widows who are domiciled in Manipur and have been residing in Manipur for more than 5 years continuously preceding the date of application are eligible under the scheme. This is a State Sponsored Scheme and only the citizens who are domiciled in the State of Manipur can apply for this scheme. The application should be submitted through the respective District Social Welfare Officer.\n<br>\n\n"

The technology helps in controlling water parameters such as dissolved oxygen, ammonia, and nitrate levels, thereby creating a conducive environment for fish and shrimp growth.1. **Water Conservation:** Bio-floc technology promotes water conservation by minimizing the need for water exchange in aquaculture systems. The microbial communities formed in bio-floc tanks help in recycling nutrients and reducing water wastage, making it a sustainable approach to aquaculture.1. **Cost Reduction:** By reducing the dependence on water exchange and minimizing the usage of artificial feeds, the adoption of bio-floc technology can potentially lead to cost savings for fish and shrimp farmers. This can contribute to the economic viability of aquaculture operations.1. **Environmental Sustainability:** The implementation of bio-floc technology aligns with the goal of environmental sustainability in aquaculture. The technology reduces the release of effluents into natural water bodies, mitigating the potential negative impacts on the environment.1. **Skill Development and Capacity Building:** The initiative may include training and capacity-building programs for farmers, providing them with knowledge and skills related to bio-floc technology and its application in aquaculture. This can empower farmers with the necessary expertise to adopt and adapt to modern aquaculture practices.\n",
