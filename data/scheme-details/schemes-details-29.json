In order to overcome this situation and to facilitate the re-entry of women having career breaks to Science research, the Kerala State Council of Science, Technology and Environment (KSCSTE) launched the “Back-to-Lab Research Fellowship Programme” in 2010. The Scheme aims to support Women Research Scholars having career breaks, to come back to research and complete the Ph.D programme. The fellowship is provided normally for a period of 3 years. The scheme is open to unemployed women of Kerala origin qualified with a post-graduate degree in Basic or Applied Science or Professional Courses.\n**Necessary conditions as per the scheme:**\n\n  - There should be a Scientist Mentor (preferably a Research guide) who is a regular faculty/staff of the institution under whose guidance the woman scientist should carry out the work. The Scientist Mentor should have at least 5 or more years of service left in the Institution before retirement. The Scientist Mentor should constantly monitor the progress of the project, facilitate smooth implementation of the programme and ensure timely submission of financial utilization certificates by the institute to KSCSTE.\n  - In case the Research Fellow submits the Thesis before the scheduled tenure of the fellowship, the Thesis Submission Certificate and other completion documents should be submitted to KSCSTE within one month so as to enable termination of the Fellowship.\n  - Research fellows availing financial assistance/stipend from other State/Central funding agencies or other sources will not be simultaneously eligible for the KSCSTE Back-to-Lab Research Fellowship. The Research Fellow should furnish an undertaking to the effect that she is not availing financial assistance/stipend from any other source simultaneously.\n  - The implementing Institute should provide full infrastructural facilities such as a laboratory, computer, library, communication, accommodation, water, electricity, etc. for smooth implementation of the project.\n  - The unutilized portion of the grant (along with the interest accrued) at the end of the project period should be refunded to Council by DD in favour of Member Secretary, KSCSTE.\n  - Scientists who publish technical/ scientific papers based on the research work done under the project should acknowledge the assistance received from KSCSTE.\n  - The Research Fellow should not enter into collaboration with a foreign party (individual/ industry) without prior approval of the Council.\n\n",

This decision is made in consultation with the Extension Officer of the Coffee Board, considering factors like water availability and other essential resources required for a healthy nursery.\n**Step 3: Group Responsibilities**\nThe group takes the responsibility of motivating their members to participate in raising the nursery and distributing the seedlings among the members.\n**Step 4: Cost Estimation and Control**\nThe concerned Extension Officer estimates the cost involved in raising the group nurseries. It is ensured that the cost of raising each healthy coffee seedling does not exceed ₹5, inclusive of input and labor costs.\n**Step 5: Proposal Submission and Consolidation**\nThe Extension Officer submits a proposal containing details of the number of seedlings to be raised and the associated expenditure to the Deputy Director (E). The Deputy Director consolidates the requirements for his region and submits them to the Joint Director (E) in Guwahati, along with recommendations.\n**Step 6: Regional Consolidation and Recommendations**\nThe Joint Director (E) consolidates the overall requirements for the North Eastern Region (NER) and submits the proposal, along with recommendations, to the Director of Research.\n**Step 7: Scrutiny and Sanction**\nThe Director of Research scrutinizes the proposal and submits it to the Head Office in Bengaluru, along with recommendations for sanction.\n**Step 8: Phased Funding Release**\nAfter sanction, the concerned Joint Director (Extn.) or Deputy Director (E) releases the approved amount in a phased manner at different stages of raising the nurseries.\n"

In the case of inter-planting of Arabica in Robusta adopting clean replanting, the subsidy will be given only to Robusta which is the main crop.\n   1. When interlined in the old blocks, the old/unproductive plants should preferably be removed after one harvest and under no circumstances beyond two harvests i.e., for instance, if interlining is done in August-September 2017, the old plants should preferably be uprooted after harvesting the standing crop by December 2017 to March 2018 or after harvesting the second crop by December 2018 to March 2019. This would ensure that the newly interlined plants would not suffer too much root competition and receive adequate sunlight for vigorous growth.\n   1. In Arabica zones with an elevation of 1000 metres above MSL, the old Arabica coffee blocks should be replanted with disease-tolerant, high-yielding Arabica varieties only. In other areas, with an elevation of less than 1000 meters above MSL, which is suitable for both Arabica and Robusta cultivation, the existing Arabica blocks replanted with Robusta material are eligible.\n   1. In states like Tamil Nadu, if coffee is grown along with intercrops like pepper, orange, banana etc., and the land documents indicate the extent of each crop separately, in such a situation, the subsidy will be based on the actual extent of the area replanted with coffee or based on the maximum extent of land mentioned in the land documents, including other intercrops, whichever is less.\n   1. As far as possible, the growers should adopt appropriate planting designs that are suitable for the mechanization of farm operations. In the case of estates that adopt such a modified planting design amenable to mechanization, the subsidy will be considered for the entire area of replanting and not based on the plant population.\n\n",

        "detailedDescription_md": "The scheme “Mission Solar Charkha” a pilot project was implemented by the Ministry of Micro, Small &amp;amp; Medium Enterprises, Government of India. The scheme envisages setting up of Solar Charkha Clusters which would mean a focal village and other surrounding villages in a radius of 8 to 10 Kilometres. Further, such a cluster will have 200 to 2042 beneficiaries (spinners, weavers, stitches, and other skilled artisans). Each spinner will be given two charkhas of 10 spindles each. On average, it is considered that such a cluster will have about 1000 charkhas. A cluster with full capacity will provide direct employment to 2042 artisans.\n         The Government of India has accorded approval to set up 50 such clusters with a budget of 550 Crores for 2018-19 and 2019-20. The Scheme is envisaged to generate direct employment of nearly one lakh persons in the approved Fifty (50) Clusters.\n**Objectives:**\n\n  - To ensure inclusive growth by the generation of employment, especially for women and youth, and sustainable development through solar charkha clusters in rural areas.\n  - To boost the rural economy and help in arresting migration from rural to urban areas.\n  - To leverage low-cost, innovative technologies and processes for sustenance.\n\n(**This is to inform that as per MSME directions, further Mission Solar Charkha will only be undertaken after the outcome of the Pilot projects is assessed (9 in number) and till such time no fresh proposals will be entertained.**)\n",
        "benefits_md": "**Project Interventions/Financial Assistance:**\n\n  - One cluster of Solar Charkha would involve a maximum subsidy of ₹9.599 cr.\n\n**The scheme would cover three types of Interventions, namely-**\n&gt; **A. Capital subsidy for individual and for Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV):**\n\n\n   1. 2000 Solar Charkhas at the maximum price of ₹45,000/- per charkha and a subsidy of ₹15,750/- per charkha works out to a cumulative subsidy of ₹3.15 crores for 1000 spinners.\n   1. One unit of two Solar Charkhas would produce 2.0 kg of yarn on average per day, resulting in a production of 2.0 tons per 2000 charkhas. Thus, 500 Solar Looms would be required to convert the yarn into the fabric at the maximum price of ₹1,10,000/- per loom and subsidy @35% at ₹38,500/- per loom and the cumulative subsidy works out to ₹1.93 crores for 500 weavers.\n   1. Capital cost of construction of work shed with a minimum space of 20,000 sq. feet with 100% subsidy at the maximum rate of up to ₹1.20 crore per cluster for the SPV.\n   1. Capital cost of Solar Grid of 50 KW capacity with 100% subsidy at the maximum rate upto ₹0.40 crore per cluster for the SPV.\n   1. One-time Capital Cost Subsidy for the SPV @35% works out to a maximum of ₹0.75 crore per Cluster for the purchase of twisting machines, dying machines, and stitching machines (500 in number) for making the unit self-sustainable and for value addition.\n\n&gt; **B. Interest subvention for Working Capital:**\n\n\n   1. It is proposed to have a ceiling of 8% of interest subvention on working capital irrespective of the interest rates being charged by the Banks/Financial Institutions for a period of six months.\n   1. Recurring Working Capital cost for a period of six months at the rate of interest subvention of 8% works out to ₹1.584 crores for one cluster including the cost of roving, and wages of spinners and weavers.\n\n&gt; **C. Capacity building:**\n\n\n   1. The scheme envisages courses for the spinners/weavers and others involved in the garmenting unit at a total cost of ₹ 0.595 crore per cluster for a period of two years.\n\n",

As the number of scholarships for Transgender persons available in a year is fixed and limited, the selection of applications would be on the basis of total marks achieved in the previous academic year as reflected in the mark sheet.\n\n#### Terms and Conditions:\n\n  - The scholarship is dependent on the satisfactory progress and conduct of the Transgender student. If it is reported by the Head of the Institution/School at any time that the student has by reasons of their own act of default failed to make satisfactory progress or has been guilty of misconduct such as resorting to or participating in strikes, irregularity in attendance without the permission of the authorities concerned, etc. The authority sanctioning the scholarship may either cancel the scholarship or stop or withhold further payment for such a period as it may dream fit.\n  - If a student violates school discipline or any other terms and conditions of the scholarship, the scholarship may be suspended or cancelled.\n  - If a student is found to have obtained a scholarship by false statement, his/her scholarship will be cancelled forthwith and the amount of the scholarship already paid will be recovered by the Ministry along with penal interest as per applicable rules.
