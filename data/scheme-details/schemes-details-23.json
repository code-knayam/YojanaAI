The scope of the scheme will include trekking in the natural beauty of a lush tea garden, undertaking a tea-testing session, visiting a modern tea factory and even trying one’s hand at plucking tea leaves, etc. All components to be undertaken under the scheme will be need-based. Moreover, the probable activities under the scheme may be as follows:-\na) Renovation of heritage bungalows.\nb) Renovation of heritage tea guest houses.\nc) Renovation of the front side of the tea garden depicting all modern tea tourism implications.\nd) Dining hall/cafeteria with all modern amenities.\ne) Development of swimming pool/spa as part of the facility.\nf) Facilities including angling, boating, water fountain, etc.\ng) Recreation facility/yoga center.\nh) Development of golf courses.\ni) Installation of solar lights.\nj) Involvement of local youths in proposed tea tourism activities to be developed.\nk) Facilities like tea testing shall be developed.\nl) Any other facility deemed fit to be incorporated for boosting tea tourism.\n<br>\n\nThe assistance or sharing pattern under the scheme is 50:50 (Government’s share: Beneficiary share). The selected Tea Gardens will be the beneficiaries under the scheme, with an upper ceiling of ₹ 2 Crore as Govt. Share. \nMonitoring: The scheme will be implemented by Assam Tourism Development Corporation (ATDC) and monitored by State Level Committee (SLC).\nFund Flow: Funds i.e. Government’s share will be released in three installments to the beneficiaries in the following manner:\nA. First Instalment: First installment which is 20 % of the eligible subsidy under the scheme will be released on completion of 30% of the total estimated project work based on the progress report to be submitted by the concerned Engineers of implementing agency.\nB.

A proposing stakeholder can be institutions of Central or State Government(s), an autonomous body/statutory body or any other equivalent body or a corporate that wants to provide training to candidates.\n<br>\n\nThe objective of Special Projects under  PMKVY 3.0 (2020-21) is to undertake project-based skilling interventions, primarily to meet the skilling needs of marginalised or vulnerable groups (to mean hereafter such as Scheduled Castes and Tribes, transgender, Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), women, economically backward people, any other category which identifies as marginalised/vulnerable and is recognised by the Government of India and State Government(s) and those from difficult/remote geographies, hard to reach areas (such as Left Wing Extremist (LWE) areas, aspirational districts, J&amp;K, Ladakh, North East states, Island territories), which may not meet all the parameters as laid down in the guidelines of Short-Term Training (STT) of PMKVY 3.0 due to special circumstances\n<br>\n\nSpecial Projects also envisages to cover short- term skilling initiatives undertaken by reputed industry bodies offering captive placement opportunities; projects with innovative strategies; projects offering local livelihood through creative market linked entrepreneurship, and/or projects assuring international placements\n<br>\n\nBy its very intent, the projects falling under the Special Projects of PMKVY 3.0 are required to be dynamic in approach and need to go beyond the routine short-term skilling to enhance the all-round competency and adeptness of the marginalised sections of the country\n<br>\n\nThe targets under Special Projects will constitute 12% in Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) component of the total allocated targets under STT of PMKVY 3.0. Such projects will be approved by PMKVY 3.0 Executive CommitteeDuring PMKVY 2.0, states were also permitted to utilise 15% of their targets towards Special Projects. Similarly, in PMKVY 3.0, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) permits States to implement 15% of their STT targets as per these Special Project guidelines, within the state STT budget. Such projects will be approved at the State level by State Empowered Committee\n"

        "detailedDescription_md": "The objective of the &amp;quot;National Renewable Energy Fellowship Scheme&amp;quot; Component of the Human Resource Development Programme in New and Renewable Energy, Human Resources Development Division, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, is to institutionalize renewable energy education and training to meet the requirement of qualified and trained manpower in the country. The HRD Programme has been with a total financial outlay of Rs. 200 crore for the period of FY 2021-22 to 2025-26.\n&lt;br&gt;\n\nThe &amp;quot;National Renewable Energy Fellowship Scheme&amp;quot; comes under the &amp;quot;Fellowships for Higher Studies and Research in Renewable Energy&amp;quot; Component of the Programme. Through this scheme, fellowships will be provided for pursuing higher studies/ advanced research in renewable energy. The fellowship scheme is directly aligned with the overall requirement of renewable energy, research thrust areas identified by MNRE, identification of technology readiness levels and focus on commercialization. The technology areas will not be of a generic nature but should involve frontier-edge research in technology development with a focused approach.\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n##### **Number of Fellowships**\n150 new fellowships/scholarships in the field of renewable energy every year in addition to existing fellowships awarded since 2017-21 (which will continue till their entire tenure). The total number of fellowships to be supported during the period is given below:\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n**Course: M.Tech.**\n**Duration of Course/ Fellowship/ Scholarship (Years): 2**\nIntake Every Year: 35\nFor Five Years: 175\nFellowship (1st Year, 2021-22): 35\nFellowship (2nd Year, 2022-23): 35+35\nFellowship (3rd Year, 2023-24): 35+35\nFellowship (4th Year, 2024-25): 35+35\nFellowship (5th Year, 2025-26): 35+35\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n**Course: M.Sc.**\n**Duration of Course/ Fellowship/ Scholarship (Years): 2**\nIntake Every Year: 10\nFor Five Years: 50\nFellowship (1st Year, 2021-22): 10\nFellowship (2nd Year, 2022-23): 10+10\nFellowship (3rd Year, 2023-24): 10+10\nFellowship (4th Year, 2024-25): 10+10\nFellowship (5th Year, 2025-26): 10+10\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n**NOTE:** The fellowship provided/sanctioned for M.Tech / M.Sc (2 yr course) during a given year will comprise the number sanctioned during that year plus the continued from the previous year. For example, in M. Tech (2-year course), if fellowship in the year 2022-23 is sanctioned x no and from the previous year 2021-22 y no. has continued, so total fellowship during 2022-23 would be X+Y. The fellowship duration of the course for a student should not exceed 2 yrs.\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n**Course: JRF**\n**Duration of Course/ Fellowship/ Scholarship (Years): 2+3**\nIntake Every Year: 20\nFor Five Years: 100\nFellowship (1st Year, 2021-22): 20\nFellowship (2nd Year, 2022-23): 40\nFellowship (3rd Year, 2023-24): 60\nFellowship (4th Year, 2024-25): 80\nFellowship (5th Year, 2025-26): 100\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n**NOTE:** JRF will lead to PHD degree (2 yrs JRF+ 3 yrs SRF) not exceeding 5 yrs. Therefore, fellowship would be provided to a student, who enters at JRF level and completes the course up to PHD i.e. maximum of 5 yrs (2 yrs for JRF +3 yrs for SRF).\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n**Course: SRF**\n**Duration of Course/ Fellowship/ Scholarship (Years): 3**\nIntake Every Year: 5\nFor Five Years: 25\nFellowship (1st Year, 2021-22): 5\nFellowship (2nd Year, 2022-23): 10\nFellowship (3rd Year, 2023-24): 15\nFellowship (4th Year, 2024-25): 15\nFellowship (5th Year, 2025-26): 15\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n**NOTE:** This is a direct route for considering fellowship at the entry-level SRF for attaining a PhD not exceeding 3 yrs.\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n**Course: RA/PDF**\n**Duration of Course/ Fellowship/ Scholarship (Years): 3**\nIntake Every Year: 5\nFor Five Years: 25\nFellowship (1st Year, 2021-22): 5\nFellowship (2nd Year, 2022-23): 10\nFellowship (3rd Year, 2023-24): 15\nFellowship (4th Year, 2024-25): 15\nFellowship (5th Year, 2025-26): 15\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n**NOTE:** RA/PDF is post-doctoral 3-year research.\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n**TOTAL**\n**Intake Every Year: 75**\n**For Five Years: 375**\nFellowship (1st Year, 2021-22): 75\nFellowship (2nd Year, 2022-23): 150\nFellowship (3rd Year, 2023-24): 180\nFellowship (4th Year, 2024-25): 200\nFellowship (5th Year, 2025-26): 220\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n**NOTE 1:** Liability for fellowships sanctioned from 2022-23 onwards will spill over beyond the scheme period as per their fellowship duration.\n**NOTE 2:** The principle of providing fellowships would be the same in each category.\n**NOTE 3:** The number of fellowships in each of the categories above is interchangeable which will depend on no. of applications received quality of research work proposed demand from the Industry etc.\n",

The AGNIPATH scheme has been designed to enable a youthful profile of the Armed Forces.\n          &amp;quot;Agnipath Yojana&amp;quot; is a new HR Management scheme for the Armed Forces. Candidates inducted through this scheme will be called Agniveers. These Agniveers once enrolled into the Indian Air Force, will be governed under the Air Force Act 1950, for a period of four years. Endeavour will be made to enroll candidates as Agniveers from all parts of the nation, utilising contemporary technology (online STAR exam and associated testing methods), specialized rallies, and campus interviews at recognized technical institutes such as Industrial Training Institutes, NSQF, etc. Agniveers would form a distinct rank in the IAF, different from any other existing rank.\n           As part of the enrolment process, each ‘Agniveer’ will be required to formally accept all terms and conditions of the AGNIPATH Scheme. For personnel below the age of 18 years, the enrolment form will need to be signed by the parents/guardians, in accordance with extant provisions.\n        Post the period of four years, all Agniveers will go back to society. However, based on organizational requirements and policies promulgated by the IAF, Agniveers who have exited will be offered an opportunity to apply for enrolment in the IAF in the regular cadre. The skills gained by each Agniveer will be captured in a certificate to form part of his resume. These applications will be considered by a centralized board in a transparent manner and not more than 25% of the strength of the specific batch of original Agniveers will be enrolled in the IAF based on performance during their four-year engagement period as Agniveers.\n           Agniveers will not have any right to be selected for further enrolment into the Armed Forces.
